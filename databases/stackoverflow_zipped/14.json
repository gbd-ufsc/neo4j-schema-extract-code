I understand the problem correctly, your application supports the upgrade of a `Person` to `Employee` and you want the record already existing in the database to be used and updated with the new attributes (e.g. `employeeId`).\r\n\r\nI think this is a problem of [Inheritance strategy][1]. You have two classes : `Person` and `Employee`, with `Employee` a subclass of `Person`. You need to decide what tables would be used to store the records corresponding to `Employee` and `Person` objetcs. \r\n\r\nIf you opt for a distinct table for each entity class, then you have to handle manually the *upgrade* of a `Person` to `Employee` (that is you remove the record in one table and add it to the other).\r\nHowever, if you choose to store both entities in a single table, then you may use the same record. See &quot;Single Table&quot; section in [the document][1]. \r\n\r\nFor this to work, you also need to make sure the unique id is the same between the classes `Person` and `Employee` (e.g. `personId`). Otherwise, you will still have two distinct records (within the same table).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as I mentioned in the beginning, any inheritance strategy would work, as long as you accept to remove the `Person` entity and create the *new* `Employee` entity upon *upgrade*. This remove / create often has a complexity depending on existing relationships and integrity constraints.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://thoughts-on-java.org/complete-guide-inheritance-strategies-jpa-hibernate/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529197/how-to-change-the-type-of-an-existing-entity-in-jpa/58530778#58530778","title":"How to change the type of an existing entity in JPA"}],"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":6783371,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eQwnc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stefano Sambruna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6783371/stefano-sambruna"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571864074,"creation_date":1571856040,"question_id":58529197,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58529197","body_markdown":"I have a web app built with Spring Boot and JPA and I would like to change the type of an entity already persisted inside the database. \r\nLet me explain it better through an example.\r\n\r\nI have an entity Person\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    public class Person{\r\n         @Id\r\n         private Long personId;\r\n         private String name;\r\n         @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;owner&quot;)\r\n         private List&lt;Car&gt; cars;\r\n         ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Repository\r\n    public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Person, Long&gt; {}\r\n\r\nthis Person may have one or more cars, which are represented by the entity type Car:\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    public class Car{\r\n         @Id\r\n         private Long carId;\r\n         @ManyToOne\r\n         @JoinColumn(name = &quot;owner_id&quot;)\r\n         private Person owner;\r\n         \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Repository\r\n    public interface CarRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Car, Long&gt; {}\r\n\r\nand an Employee classe which inherits from Person:\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    public class Employee extends Person{\r\n         private String employeeId;\r\n         ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Repository\r\n    public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Employee, Long&gt; {}\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say we persist an entity of type Person inside the database.

And the two options to choose from:  \r\n\r\n 1. Recreating the component each time you need that (which invokes recreating the internals, initializing getters/setters fields, initializing component&#39;s watcher, registering to observe changes and initializing component&#39;s MessageChannel)  \r\n 2.

change...we now use the transform method for the vectorizer. I am assuming you can put this test code into the same file as your training code so that your vectorizer object is still alive.\r\n\r\nThe reason you use transform and *not* fit_transform is that you have trained your model using the vectorizer fitted with a particular vocabulary and during testing new words may appear.  Using the existing vectorizer will ignore these new words/combos and will serve to keep your tdif vectors harmonized.  As opposed to using fit_transform which recreates, possibly quite differently, your vectorizer which will have small/large differences.\r\n\r\nedit: you may wish to try a logistic classifier as well...sometimes it gives decent results on this sort of data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529185/scikit-randomforrestclassifier-real-results-not-matching-prediction-score/58529527#58529527","title":"scikit RandomForrestClassifier - real results not matching prediction score"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12264593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e093d754928b1169d677e4c6d60da9d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tommy_szlang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12264593/tommy-szlang"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571857621,"creation_date":1571855996,"question_id":58529185,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58529185","body_markdown":"I am new to machine learning and I am trying to classify text using a scikit RandomForrestClassifier.

If a process tries to write to the pipe faster than another process reads from it, the pipe will eventually fill up.

In this case, trying to write to a full pipe will return an error indication, and the writing code can decide how to deal with it.

Is there a better way to determine the actual location setting or is this just a bug/quirky behavior from Apple?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529132/what-is-the-correct-way-to-find-the-actual-location-permission-setting-in-ios-13","title":"What is the correct way to find the actual location permission setting in iOS 13?

Can u suggest a tool where I can easily achieve this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529124/html-mockups-recomendation","closed_reason":"off-topic","title":"HTML Mockups Recomendation"},{"tags":["matlab","mex"],"owner":{"reputation":826,"user_id":529482,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16f658eea0c4290ac7dd7587196b7d39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"samprat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/529482/samprat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571855730,"creation_date":1571855730,"question_id":58529122,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58529122","body_markdown":"I am trying to access C++ code from Matlab R2018a but getting error  \r\n\r\n    Invalid MEX-file &#39;C:\\\\C++ForMatlab\\test.mexw64&#39;: Gateway function is\r\n    missing.\r\n\r\nI did the similar thing on Windows 7 with VS2013 and Matlab 2016 and it all worked fine. \r\n\r\nThe function compiles successfully and dll is created as expected but when I try to run it  I got error message.     \r\n\r\n**OS --&gt;** Windows 10   \r\n\r\n**Matlab --&gt;** Matlab R2018a\r\n   \r\n **C++ -&gt;** VS 2017 \r\n\r\nSample code written in VS2017 \r\n\r\n**FileName** --&gt; test.cpp    \r\n    \r\n     #include &quot;mex.h&quot;\r\n    \r\n    void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[])\r\n    {\r\n    \tmexPrintf(&quot;Hello World!\\n&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn Matlab \r\nI type following command\r\n\r\n     mex test.cpp\r\n\r\nAnd Output I get is\r\n\r\n    Building with &#39;Microsoft Visual C++ 2017&#39;.\r\n    MEX completed successfully.\r\n\r\nBut After that when I try to run by typing \r\n\r\n    Trial&gt;&gt; test\r\n\r\nI get following error\r\n\r\n    Invalid MEX-file &#39;C:\\C++ForMatlab\\test.mexw64&#39;: Gateway function is\r\n    missing\r\n\r\n.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529122/gateway-function-missing-matlab-2018a-mex","title":"Gateway function missing --&gt;Matlab 2018a --&gt;Mex"},{"tags":["windows","interface"],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":960018,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b1dfaa02e2353b64b78d4b6b2c30d26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Veet Vivarto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/960018/veet-vivarto"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571855728,"creation_date":1571855728,"question_id":58529119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58529119","body_markdown":"I saw this question answered for Windows 7 almost 10 years ago.\r\nAt that time most answers were that it is probably not a good idea.\r\nI wonder if anything has changed since then.\r\nCertainly Microsoft applications are using the title bar.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMigA.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529119/does-win-10-allow-to-add-icons-to-the-title-bar","title":"Does Win 10 allow to add icons to the Title Bar?"},{"tags":["python","javamail"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1420,"user_id":3126085,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d1b5320d5edffe38958e8ca1129ab32?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"crookedleaf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3126085/crookedleaf"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571855945,"post_id":58529118,"comment_id":103382271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529118/how-to-use-javamail-api-in-python#comment103382271_58529118"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3915500,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c01a5c692205544fd58b115c3e603e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ahmetanildindar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3915500/ahmetanildindar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571855719,"creation_date":1571855719,"question_id":58529118,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58529118","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a Python code which sends email at certain intervals.

evaluates to a value of type `size_t`. The proper specifier for `size_t` in C99 is `%zu`. You can use `%u` on systems where `size_t` and `unsigned int` are the same type or at least have the same size and representation. On 64-bit systems, `size_t` values have 64 bits and therefore are larger than 32-bit ints. On 64-bit linux and OS/X, this type is defined as `unsigned long` and on 64-bit Windows as `unsigned long long`, hence using `%lu` or `%llu` on these systems is fine too.\r\n\r\nPassing a `size_t` for an incompatible conversion specification has undefined behavior:\r\n\r\n* the program could crash (and it probably will if you use `%s`)\r\n* the program could display the expected value (as it might for `%d`)\r\n* the program could produce weird output such as `nan` for `%f` or something else...\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is integers and floating point values are passed in different ways to `printf` and they have a different representation. Passing an integer where `printf` expects a `double` will let `printf` retrieve the floating point value from registers or memory locations that have random contents. In your case, the floating point register just happens to contain a `nan` value, but it might contain a different value elsewhere in the program or at a later time, nothing can be expected, the behavior is undefined.\r\n\r\nSome legacy systems do not support `%zu`, notably C runtimes by Microsoft. On these systems, you can use `%u` or `%lu` and use a cast to convert the `size_t` to an `unsigned` or an `unsigned long`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint a = 0;\r\nlong long d = 1000000000000;\r\nint s = a + d;\r\nprintf(&quot;%u\\n&quot;, (unsigned)sizeof(a + d));       // should print 8\r\nprintf(&quot;%lu\\n&quot;, (unsigned long)sizeof(s));     // should print 4\r\nprintf(&quot;%llu\\n&quot;, (unsigned long long)sizeof(d)); // prints 4 or 8 depending on the system\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58529076/sizeof-with-different-specificators/58529506#58529506","title":"Sizeof with different specificators"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":88879,"user_id":134554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1894f68e0b15fd3d5b27bfcb021fa11c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Bode","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134554/john-bode"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571861338,"creation_date":1571861338,"answer_id":58530303,"question_id":58529076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530303","body_markdown":"&gt; I want to know for my own knowledge what happens behind and why it prints `nan` when I use it with `%f` or a long number when used with `%lf`\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `printf` doesn&#39;t know the types of the additional arguments you actually pass to it.  It&#39;s relying on the format string to tell it the number and types of additional arguments to *expect*.  If you pass a `size_t` as an additional argument, but tell `printf` to expect a `float`, then `printf` will interpret the bit pattern of the additional argument as a `float`, not a `size_t`.  Integer and floating point types have radically different representations, so you&#39;ll get values you don&#39;t expect (including NaN).    \r\n\r\nSecondly, different types have different sizes.  If you pass a 16-bit `short` as an argument, but tell `printf` to expect a 64-bit `double` with `%f`, then `printf` is going to look at the extra bytes immediately following that argument.  It&#39;s not guaranteed that `size_t` and `double` have the same sizes, so `printf` may either be ignoring part of the actual value, or using bytes from memory that isn&#39;t part of the value.  \r\n\r\nFinally, it depends on how arguments are being passed.  Some architectures use registers to pass arguments (at least for the first few arguments) rather than the stack, and different registers are used for floats vs. integers, so if you pass an integer and tell it to expect a double with `%f`, `printf` may look in the *wrong place altogether* and print something completely random.  \r\n\r\n`printf` is not smart.  It relies on you to use the correct conversion specifier for the type of the argument you want to pass.

You wish to run a python program on a local machine (say windows pc), and have that program use IBM&#39;s Watson. You can run your python application on your machine, which then makes a RESTful call to the Watson API. You could use the python &quot;requests&quot; package to perform such an action. The following links to the [Doc for Watson Assistant API calls][1], you can use either [V1.0][1] or [V2.0][2] of the API calls, and expect the individual API call you wish is the message API. &lt;br/&gt;\r\nAgain normally the Watson Assistant service is cloud based, even if you code is local on you machine/server.
