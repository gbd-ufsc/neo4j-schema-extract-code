Since the language was standardised after multiple implementations had been in place for a while, ECMAScript was defined retroactively, in part:\r\n\r\n&gt; The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations [...]\r\n\r\n(from the 7th paragraph of [&quot;Introduction&quot;](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-intro))\r\n\r\nIn any case, crucially, ECMAScript does not allow parallel script execution -- a JavaScript function call, for example, will never be interrupted by any other function call, period. Not within the same [realm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-code-realms) (in Web browsers one realm is associated with one single rendered Web page).\r\n\r\nWe can dig deeper into the &quot;why&quot; if we imagine a JavaScript runtime tasked with calling an `async` function, and see what it would take for the runtime to arrange for returning the actual value, when the value would depend on an asynchronous operation. So let&#39;s use your `getBase64` function as an example. Now, we would obviously be violating the language specification doing this, but it&#39;s just to arrive at an explanation.\r\n\r\nLooking inside the body of `getBase64`, let&#39;s assume that `axios.get(...)` is a potentially lengthy operation because it fetches a resource on the network. If we assume it isn&#39;t, `getBase64` does not have to be `async`, cannot use `await`, and behaves like a regular function. So, for the sake of this answer, we do assume it involves a lengthy operation, and we do not have the value for `response` before this lengthy operation completes. `axios.get` may be fetching a resource over network, but the nature of the operation doesn&#39;t really matter, what matters is that the operation may potentially take longer time than completing execution of the entire script otherwise would.\r\n\r\nSo, can we continue executing the body of `getBase64` and return before `axios.get(...)` completes? For the sake of the argument, we *could* execute *some* parts of it that *do not depend* on the promise returned by `axios.get(...)` being resolved. That&#39;s called automatic code parallelisation. ECMAScript does not define that and may not even allow it. Few languages do. But as I mentioned, it is otherwise technically possible to evaluate those statements in the function body that do not depend on the resolved promise, but in any case, the return value of `getBase64` depends on `response`, indirectly, so we at least need the lengthy operation to complete before returning. That&#39;s the important thing.\r\n\r\nSo if we *cannot* return yet, we have to wait for the promise returned by `axios.get(...)` to resolve. I mean, one way or another we need to have `response` before returning a value from `getBase64`. \r\n\r\nHere is where it gets interesting. A scripting runtime always has an environment it actually scripts. Part of this environment may be the browser window (`window`), a Web page (`document`) or something else entirely. As a notable example of a compliant ECMAScript runtime, Node.js has an environment, too. A question then comes to mind -- what to do if an event needs to be dispatched by the environment while `getBase64` is waiting for the `axios.get(...)` to resolve? There may be an incoming network request (Node.js) or user clicking on a link (Web browser). You have an event listener attached, too (wouldn&#39;t be much point in having events you can&#39;t react to, would it?). Now, do you call and start executing the event listener while the `getBase64` call is waiting for `response`, or do you wait for execution of `getBase64` and the rest of the script (think of the call chain) to complete, risking poor user experience for having user wait for potentially &quot;long&quot; time (the network is &quot;slow&quot;, for example)?\r\n\r\nIf you start executing the event handler, you invariably end up with two script execution contexts in parallel -- the event handler execution and the `getBase64` call waiting for `axios.get(...)` to resolve. In effect, your event handler is executing while `getBase64` is still in progress, even if the agent only uses one single thread of execution where the former pre-empts the latter. It&#39;s still parallel script execution. This is no small matter -- behaviour of your script, in particular the order of statements being executed, now depends on the event timing! You will have to deal with potential race conditions, and state synchronisation problems in general.\r\n\r\nIf you *do not* allow parallel script execution, you have to serialise it. Meaning finishing one script execution -- completing the `getBase64` call and the rest of the script that ended up calling it, for instance -- and only then starting another, like execution of an event handler.\r\n\r\nThis is what ECMAScript designers went for. They decided to forbid parallel script execution in return for the simplicity this gets developers by freeing them from having to deal with an entire class of parallel programming problems briefly mentioned above. This constrains runtime developers in a way where different compliant *runtimes* executing same script will evaluate the statements present in the script in the same order, and not depending on event timing, for one.\r\n\r\nSome may call this overspecification of the language, but I believe I have made some sort of a case for it. In any case, JavaScript had much more modest ambitions before it was standardised, and relative ease of scripting attainable by avoiding situations that stem from parallel script execution, and a simpler Web browser architecture as a result, in a time when no one spoke of CPU &quot;cores&quot;, were priorities. ECMAScript standardised that behaviour with a rigidly specified model.\r\n\r\nThis of course still leaves us with a problem of &quot;freezing&quot; pages when script execution takes too long to complete, since executing event handlers and anything affecting the environment exposed to scripts, must be delayed until current execution completes. And if you ever tried to calculate anything complex enough in your page scripts, you know what I mean. No two script executions happen in parallel. Execution of callbacks for intervals, timers, promises and other operations are queued and done in their own execution contexts, as is script execution. These and other jobs -- actual progression of network requests and operations initiated by different kind of APIs -- use ECMAScript job queues. On top of that, HTML specifies something called [event loops](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#event-loops) which also use job queues internally. These specifications rigidly define how events are handled, when callbacks are fired by different APIs, and otherwise still allow the scripting environment to stay responsive between hopefully short-lived script executions.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, `async` function execution, as you may have discerned from the [&quot;AsyncFunctionStart&quot; definition of the specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-async-functions-abstract-operations-async-function-start), is split into multiple jobs at well-defined points. True to the specification, there is no parallel script execution going on, yet the function still effectively &quot;waits&quot; with every `await` expression.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion yes, we technically could have `async` functions always return the values you tell them to return with the `return` keyword, but you would be trading in great deal of simplicity of JavaScript development in return for a different kind of &quot;simplicity&quot;, allowing interruptions of `async` functions (interleaving execution contexts in general) in order to mask callback/promise handling and be able to directly work with return values, but needing to watch state changes more closely and ever being wary of the runtime peculiarities. The ECMAScript designers made the choice for you.\r\n\r\n### Why can&#39;t *some* `async` functions return &quot;actual&quot; values?\r\n\r\nEven without allowing of parallel script execution, technically nothing would stop an `async` function that doesn&#39;t use `await` from returning the value you intend it to. Such function would be able to execute to completion without waiting on any promise. Basically it then behaves as an ordinary function, being `async` &quot;in name only&quot;. But you&#39;d be violating ECMAScript specification which mandates that `async` functions always return a promise. Again, a decision by designers of the ECMAScript specification.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind their decision isn&#39;t known to me, but I dare argue it is so that one wouldn&#39;t have to look at the implementation of an `async` function (&quot;are there any `await` keywords here?&quot;) in order to know how to use it -- one can use the same kind of code (like using `await`) for calling the function and handling the result, simply knowing if it&#39;s `async` or not. If it is, you&#39;d be using `await foo()` or `foo().then(result =&gt; { ... })` where `foo` is such `async` function, and it would always work no matter if execution of `foo` itself includes `await` or not (`async function foo() { return 1; }`). You wouldn&#39;t need to look at its implementation. I think this is called a &quot;calling contract&quot;.\r\n\r\n### Why can&#39;t one use `await` without `async`?\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner to the rationale explained above, the decision to mandate functions be marked as `async` in order to be able to use `await` is, again, a choice on part of ECMAScript designers. ECMAScript could allow any function to use `await` but then, because the language does not allow parallel script execution, any such function would need to return a promise lest it severely impact due event handling. Assuming the former and staying with this thought, either all functions would then be returning promises, or only those that use `await` would be. *All* JavaScript functions always returning promises would probably be considered a terrible idea by at least ECMAScript designers, and the sentiment you yourself express with your question would seem to share their opinion. Having only those functions that use `await` always return promises, while a better idea, will imply that the type of value being returned by a function *varies with the function&#39;s implementation*, something that sort of flies in the face of the principle of &quot;calling contracts&quot;, again -- you would need to know whether `foo` uses `await` in order to know how to work with the result of calling this `foo`. ECMAScript designers opted against it, expectedly, in my opinion, and this is why functions that use `await` must be explicitly marked -- with `async`.\r\n\r\nAlso, both specifications arguably help make for more optimized language runtimes.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I use &quot;ECMAScript&quot; and &quot;JavaScript&quot; interchangeably -- discussing the distinction, if any, is beyond the scope of the answer and should in any case have little bearing on the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-intro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103870/why-does-this-async-await-function-return-a-promise/58116356#58116356","title":"Why does this async/await function return a promise?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4123,"user_id":5664434,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ws_m-ConuqI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/yJVKiI7N47Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"marzelin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5664434/marzelin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570878182,"creation_date":1570878182,"answer_id":58353455,"question_id":58103870,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58353455","body_markdown":"Because it gives you a choice what to do.

I would like to identify these groups and separate them, however these data are not very regular, in particular:\r\n\r\n - There is roughly one group of data per hour but they are not strictly confined within the same hour\r\n - The time resolution is 5 seconds (this is fixed) \r\n - The number of data in each group is not fixed but they are roughly 10 minutes long\r\n - There are missing data in each group (10%-20% roughly)\r\n - The start time of each data group can vary of several minutes (in some cases is a drift in others is a step change)\r\n\r\nI can achieve this result by looping over the dataframe elements and look for consecutive missing data above a certain threshold (5 or 10 minutes for example). However this is a slow and ugly solution.\r\n\r\nI checked the itertools and more-itertools libraries but I didn&#39;t find any solution that could serve my scope. The more_itertools.consecutive_groups function does something similar but I don&#39;t know how to use it to handle the missing data in each group.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking more for a general idea/implementation scheme but if you want to play with some data you can generate a random time series with the code below. However, this is not perfectly representative as the starting time and duration of each group is fixed.\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n \r\n    idx= pd.date_range(start=&#39;2019-01-01 00:00:00&#39;, end=&#39;2019-01-01 23:00:00&#39;,freq=&#39;5s&#39;)\r\n    df=pd.DataFrame(index=idx)\r\n    df[&#39;data&#39;]=np.nan\r\n    df[(df.index.minute&gt;5)&amp;(df.index.minute&lt;15)]=1\r\n\r\n    idxlist=df[(df.index.minute&gt;5)&amp;(df.index.minute&lt;15)].index\r\n    randidx=np.random.choice(idxlist,500)\r\n    df.loc[pd.DatetimeIndex(randidx)]=np.nan\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have a strict definition for a &quot;group&quot; but if you plot the data from the example above it should be obvious. Data comes in bunches and are separated by long intervals of nan, each of these bunches is a group.

I do not know how to get a map of the form: (width, height, normals) i.e. the shape should be (w x h x 3).\r\n\r\nHow can I get such a map? Which Fragment, vertex, geometry shaders are needed for this?\r\n\r\nI provide the following inputs to the Vertex shader: \r\n\r\n```\r\nlayout (location = 0) in vec3 vertexPosition_modelspace;\r\nlayout (location = 1) in vec3 normal;\r\n\r\nuniform mat4 ModelMatrix;\r\nuniform mat4 ViewMatrix;\r\nuniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to get a smooth normal map, where every pixel corresponds to a normalized normal vector. Which shaders do I need for this?\r\nWhat I need to do is to render a normal map from a scene. I use marching cubes to get the triangles, normals and vertices. I added a normal buffer. I do not have texture.\r\n\r\n```\r\nNormalBuffer = glGenBuffers(1)\r\nprint(NormalBuffer.shape)\r\nglBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, NormalBuffer)\r\nglBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, normal_arrays[i], GL_STATIC_DRAW)\r\nnormal_buffers[i] = NormalBuffer\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use this to draw the triangles and to bind the buffer object.\r\n```\r\nglBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, normal_buffers[i])\r\nglVertexAttribPointer(1,           \r\n                      3,      \r\n                      GL_FLOAT,     \r\n                      GL_FALSE,     \r\n                      0,            \r\n                      None)         \r\n\r\nglDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES,\r\n               index[1]*index[0],\r\n               GL_UNSIGNED_INT,\r\n               None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to render the normal map with the shader and how?

PowerMockito.doNothing().when(keyStoreMock).load(any(InputStream.class),Mockito.any(char[].class)); \r\n    X509Certificate cert = Mockito.mock(X509Certificate.class); \r\n    when(keyStoreMock.getCertificate(any())).thenReturn(cert); \r\n    when(cert.getNotAfter()).thenReturn(mockDate);\r\n\r\n  \r\nunable to mock keyStore.getInstance() which returns the of KeyStore class mock object.\r\n\r\n**Source Code:**\r\n\r\n    KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());\r\n    keystore.load(new FileInputStream(filename), password.toCharArray());\r\n    X509Certificate certificate = (X509Certificate)keystore.getCertificate(&quot;Cert_name&quot;);  \r\n    endate = certificate.getNotAfter();\r\n\r\n\r\nI think KeyStore.getInstance() returns null, how to overcome this issue.\r\n\r\nColud any one plz help me out to mock the keystore.getInstance() method.

However, my code runs within an azure function app so running the code within an asp.net core app is not necessarily an option. (the function within the function app is triggered by subscription message)\r\n\r\nAre there any simple caching options I have available such that I can cache something as simple as a single token?\r\n\r\nI would like to use something simple, since my use case appears to be on the simple side, rather than needing something full blown like redis. \r\n\r\nAny insight is appreciated. \r\n\r\nHere is again a summary of what I am up against\r\n. Azure Function App with single function --&gt; External API\r\nwhere External API requires access token.\r\n\r\nOne potential way for me to solve the problem is to simply obtain a new token upon invoking the function every time. But, this requires 2 API requests each function invocation. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103803/what-caching-options-are-available-for-azure-function-app","title":"What caching options are available for Azure Function app?"},{"tags":["java","oop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24661,"user_id":1898563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d99204bcce923f40f5c72b7f80121644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1898563/michael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433052,"post_id":58103802,"comment_id":102598810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103802/whats-the-best-rpg-coding-practice-according-to-oop-design#comment102598810_58103802"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12120693,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9930f9a89b370d5d57917390a3be7955?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"desmond_jones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12120693/desmond-jones"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24661,"user_id":1898563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d99204bcce923f40f5c72b7f80121644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1898563/michael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433790,"post_id":58103802,"comment_id":102599091,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103802/whats-the-best-rpg-coding-practice-according-to-oop-design#comment102599091_58103802"},{"owner":{"reputation":3007,"user_id":11434552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acfa76b7cc964815964c586b2c85f31e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nexevis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11434552/nexevis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433832,"post_id":58103802,"comment_id":102599113,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103802/whats-the-best-rpg-coding-practice-according-to-oop-design#comment102599113_58103802"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24661,"user_id":1898563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d99204bcce923f40f5c72b7f80121644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1898563/michael"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24661,"user_id":1898563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d99204bcce923f40f5c72b7f80121644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1898563/michael"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"community_owned_date":1569433560,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569433942,"last_edit_date":1569433942,"creation_date":1569433560,"answer_id":58103955,"question_id":58103802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58103955","body_markdown":"In the simple case, a player&#39;s stats are basically just an aggregation of their base stats + their equipment stats. \r\n\r\nSeems like an opportunity to share an interface:\r\n\r\n    public interface StatProvider {\r\n        int health();\r\n\r\n        int intellect();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Ring implements StatProvider {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int health() {\r\n            return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int intellect() {\r\n            return 5;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Mage implements StatProvider {\r\n\r\n        private final int baseHealth = 100;\r\n        private final int baseIntellect = 20;\r\n        \r\n        private List&lt;StatProvider&gt;

As per my knowledge custom processor can have only one parent NAR and NAR = bundle?\r\n\r\n - What is the preferred way to specify multiple NiFi bundles in pom.xml\r\n\r\n - Ideally I do not want to bundle Hadoop related dependencies or NiFi dependencies in my NAR file. or is it mandetory in NiFi to bundle these dependencies?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103800/how-to-bundle-custom-nifi-processor-which-uses-multiple-bundles","title":"How to bundle custom NiFi processor which uses multiple bundles?"},{"tags":["python","flask-restful"],"owner":{"reputation":366,"user_id":2079445,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3054d111aa00407c8d8000957ad9958?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ling","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2079445/ling"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569432899,"creation_date":1569432899,"question_id":58103799,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103799","body_markdown":"I have a Flask restful service and I can access it through:\r\n\r\n        st = &quot;http://0.0.0.0:3000/sentence={}&quot;\r\n        url_str = st.format(text).replace(&#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;&#39;)\r\n        req = requests.get(url_str).content\r\n        bs = json.loads(BeautifulSoup(req, features=&quot;html.parser&quot;).string)\r\n\r\nI can access it on my own computer.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I start a VPN service on my computer, and then want to start this restful, it always fails:\r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;/my-envs/dialog-envs/lib/python3.7/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py&quot;, line 600, in urlopen\r\n        chunked=chunked)\r\n      File &quot;/my-envs/dialog-envs/lib/python3.7/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py&quot;, line 384, in _make_request\r\n        six.raise_from(e, None)\r\n      File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 2, in raise_from\r\n      File &quot;/my-envs/dialog-envs/lib/python3.7/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py&quot;, line 380, in _make_request\r\n        httplib_response = conn.getresponse()\r\n      File &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/http/client.py&quot;, line 1321, in getresponse\r\n        response.begin()\r\n      File &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/http/client.py&quot;, line 296, in begin\r\n        version, status, reason = self._read_status()\r\n      File &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/http/client.py&quot;, line 257, in _read_status\r\n        line = str(self.fp.readline(_MAXLINE + 1), &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;)\r\n      File &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/socket.py&quot;, line 589, in readinto\r\n        return self._sock.recv_into(b)\r\n    ConnectionResetError: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer\r\n    \r\n    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nWhy do I have to turn off &#39;VPN&#39;

_&quot;It appears to me that the dependency linkage on the npm site is only applicable to the current/latest version.&quot;_\r\n\r\nYes that&#39;s correct, `www.npmjs.com` will _only_ show the dependencies for the latest version of a package.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of ways to discover what you want both programmatically and non-programmatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Programmatically:\r\n\r\n1. Utilizing the [`npm view`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view.html) command with the following syntax;\r\n\r\n        npm view &lt;pkg_name&gt; versions --json\r\n\r\n    obtains a list of all versions available for a given package in the npm registry.\r\n\r\n    &lt;sub&gt;**Note:** The `&lt;pkg_name&gt;` part above should be substituted with the real package name.&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\n    For instance; running the following command for let&#39;s say the [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) package:\r\n\r\n        npm view eslint versions --json\r\n\r\n    prints the following to the console:\r\n\r\n    &gt; ```json\r\n    [\r\n      &quot;0.0.4&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.0.5&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.0.6&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.0.7&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.1.0-dev&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.1.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.1.1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;0.1.2&quot;,\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n    &gt;```\r\n\r\n2. Now we know what versions are available, let&#39;s say we want to list the _dependencies_ for `eslint` version `0.1.2` we can run the following command:\r\n\r\n        npm show eslint@0.1.2 dependencies --json\r\n\r\n    This will print:\r\n\r\n    &gt;```json\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;optimist&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n      &quot;estraverse&quot;: &quot;~1.3.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;esprima&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n      &quot;escope&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    &gt;```\r\n\r\n    Similarly, we can discover the _devDependencies_ for `eslint` version `0.1.2` by running the following command instead:\r\n\r\n        npm show eslint@0.1.2 devDependencies --json\r\n\r\n    This will yield something like this:\r\n\r\n    &gt;```json\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;vows&quot;: &quot;~0.7.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;sinon&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n      &quot;commonjs-everywhere&quot;: &quot;~0.9.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;mocha&quot;: &quot;~1.13.0&quot;,\r\n      &quot;chai&quot;: &quot;~1.8.1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;grunt&quot;: &quot;~0.4.1&quot;,\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    &gt;```\r\n\r\n3. If you know that a package has a particular dependency in advance. \r\n\r\n    For instance; retrospectively after running the aforementioned command we now know that `eslint` version `0.1.2` has `escope` listed as a dependency.\r\n\r\n    So, if we wanted to know the version of `escope` that `eslint` version `0.1.2` needs, we can run the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\n        npm show eslint@0.1.2 dependencies.escope\r\n                                          ^\r\n\r\n    &lt;sub&gt;**Note:** The package name follows the dot (`.`), i.e. `.escope`&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\n    This prints the following:\r\n\r\n    &gt; `1.0.0`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n###The non-programmatic way\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t think of a reason why you would want to perform the following non-programmatic way instead of the aforementioned programmatic way when you have a CLI tool available to you. However, if you prefer manual tasks then here goes...\r\n\r\n_**Note**: YMMV using the following manual steps as it depends on how the package has been managed/maintained._\r\n\r\nTypically, the source code of an npm package will be hosted on GitHub, so you can perform the following manual steps. This will avoid you having to download the package to inspect the _package.json_ file.\r\n\r\nFor this we&#39;ll demonstrate for the `eslint` package:\r\n\r\n1. Visit [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and type the name of the package in the _&quot;Search Packages&quot;_ input field. We&#39;ll type `eslint` and hit the return key.\r\n\r\n2. Next click `eslint` from the list of packages, which will take you to [this page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint).\r\n\r\n3. Click on the _github_ link which typically appears on the right-hand side of the webpage and looks like this:\r\n\r\n    [![github rep link icon][1]][1]\r\n\r\n3. That will take you to the `eslint` repo, i.e. [this one](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)\r\n\r\n4. On the Github page click the _&quot;Branch&quot;_ button - which appears above the list of source code files, and looks like this:\r\n\r\n    [![Github branch button][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. In the _pop-up_ panel that subsequently appears click the _&quot;Tags&quot;_ button, then locate and click the version tag from the list that you want to discover it&#39;s dependencies. _(Note: These tag names will typically correspond to the version released/published to npm)_ \r\n\r\n    This will then load the source code files in the browser for that particular release/version.\r\n\r\n6. Locate the _package.json_ file from the list of files and click it. This will load the contents of  _package.json_ in the browser, upon which you can read it and ascertain its dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n###Visualizing the dependency tree\r\n\r\nI sometimes utilize this online tool [https://npm.anvaka.com](https://npm.anvaka.com) which can help you to visualize the complete dependency tree/graph for a given package - however it&#39;s for the latest version of a package only.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/eslint) is the complete dependency tree/graph (many levels deep) for the latest version of eslint.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

So you don&#39;t have to *&quot;deconstruct [your] file into dictionaries/collections and rebuild it&quot;* since... it already is. This is why it&#39;s necessary to add in the Microsoft Scripting Runtime library to use it. \r\n\r\nThe struggle you are dealing with is that you are treating every object in your `json` object as a dictionary. Instead you want to `add`(pop) to the `entries` collection. A good way to keep these separate is that in VBA JSON (as far as I&#39;ve seen) if an object is a key/value pair, then it&#39;s a `Dictionary` and if it&#39;s just an object without a `key` then it&#39;s a `Collection`. I&#39;m certain there is more nuance there, but it works well in this scenario.\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n    Sub test()\r\n        Dim Json As Object\r\n        Set Json = JsonConverter.ParseJson(&quot;[{&quot;&quot;Entries&quot;&quot;:[{&quot;&quot;Date&quot;&quot;: 2019-09-25,&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;: 1,&quot;&quot;b&quot;&quot;: 2}]}]&quot;)\r\n         \r\n        Dim entry1 As Object\r\n        Set entry1 = Json(1)(&quot;Entries&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        Stop &#39;&lt;--inspect Locals and see that we have a Collection here\r\n        \r\n        &#39;Add to the collection (different then adding to a dictionary)\r\n        &#39;We will add a dictionary to the collection though\r\n        Json(1)(&quot;Entries&quot;).Add New Dictionary\r\n        \r\n        &#39;Now add to the dictionary.\r\n        Json(1)(&quot;Entries&quot;)(2).Add &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;2019-09-26&quot;\r\n        \r\n        Stop\r\n        \r\n        Debug.Print JsonConverter.ConvertToJson(Json)\r\n        \r\n        &#39;Alternatively you could create the dictionary and add your keys, then `pop` your entries\r\n        Dim Entry As Dictionary\r\n        Set Entry = New Dictionary\r\n        Entry.Add &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;2019-09-26&quot;\r\n        Entry.Add &quot;a&quot;, &quot;2&quot;\r\n        Entry.Add &quot;b&quot;, &quot;3&quot;\r\n        \r\n        Json(1)(&quot;Entries&quot;).Add Entry\r\n        \r\n        Debug.Print JsonConverter.ConvertToJson(Json)\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should spit out what you are after (I think):\r\n\r\n    [{&quot;Entries&quot;:[{&quot;Date&quot;:&quot;2019-09-25&quot;,&quot;a&quot;:1,&quot;b&quot;:2},{&quot;Date&quot;:&quot;2019-09-26&quot;}]}]\r\n\r\nI guess another way to think through this is that if we want to add a new array to our `Entries` then we have to add a new `Dictionary` object to the `Entries` collection. Then we can add into the dictionary our key/value pairs like `Date`, `a`, and `b`. \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103778/vba-json-add-entry-to-existing-file/58104219#58104219","title":"VBA-JSON: Add entry to Existing File"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11736976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UX72scn7ZQw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re47MM0t4S6btkoez7BmVpXKARbOg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sigil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11736976/sigil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58104219,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569435443,"creation_date":1569432831,"question_id":58103778,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103778","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using excel to modify existing JSON with the VBA-JSON library and I&#39;m effectively trying to do what .push from javascript does, adding another entry to the nested array.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s this previously posted question which illustrates what I&#39;m trying to do but in the scope of creating a JSON file.\r\n \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/49032724/vba-json-create-nested-objects\r\n\r\nThe accepted answer while helpful, doesn&#39;t show me how to add to what I already have without rebuilding it entirely.

I wouldn&#39;t want a visible scroll bar either way on my left sidebar. \r\n\r\n As I used lipsum quite a lot to be able to show the issue, here&#39;s my CodePen: https://codepen.io/fergos2/pen/MWgLqgL?editors=1100\r\n\r\nThe code is also found below with the lipsum removed.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for helping this newbie!\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      margin: 0 auto;\r\n      background-color: #eee;\r\n      \r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-rows: min-content 1fr;\r\n      grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;\r\n      grid-gap: 15px;\r\n      \r\n      grid-template-areas: &quot;head head head&quot;\r\n                           &quot;leftbar main rightbar&quot;;\r\n      \r\n      &amp;

Then, we supply this list to `Tasks.whenAllSuccess()` and create a new `Task` named `finalTask`. We then attach an `OnSuccessListener` to `finalTask` whose `onSuccess()` method is called when all the supplied tasks get completed. What we get in `onSuccess()` is a list of `DocumentSnapshot` of each document. We can now go through this list and get the `DocumentReference`.\r\n\r\nHope it helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103756/firestore-task-with-for-each-loop/58242153#58242153","title":"Firestore task with for each loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11181538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7859eec4895b02e83cc48a7202dcc3ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xblaz3kx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11181538/xblaz3kx"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11181538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7859eec4895b02e83cc48a7202dcc3ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xblaz3kx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11181538/xblaz3kx"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570238468,"creation_date":1569432720,"last_edit_date":1569451241,"question_id":58103756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103756","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to retrieve document references from Firestore in a for loop (without iterating through the subset).

These are timestamps in the HH:MM sense, from 00:00 to 23:59.  What I&#39;d like to do is aggregate each hour in a day, and optionally also be able to break it out further into PdDistrict as well.  (So this dataset would break down to a count of rows for the 8:00 hour on Wednesday, one for the 8:00 hour on Thursday, and one for the single 9:00 event on Thursday.  If I could then say &quot;*x* occurrences on Wednesday at 8:00 in Park&quot;, so much the better.)\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**  I forgot to mention that I&#39;m also having a similar problem trying to use the timestamps as an axis on a plot; the closest I&#39;ve gotten is with ```scale_x_time()```, but that looks like it&#39;s interpreting the time as min:sec, e.g., 00:08:30.\r\n```\r\n&quot;DayOfWeek&quot;,&quot;Time&quot;,&quot;PdDistrict&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:30&quot;,&quot;NORTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;PARK&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;08:30&quot;,&quot;TARAVAL&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;SOUTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;NORTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;CENTRAL&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;BAYVIEW&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;PARK&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:30&quot;,&quot;CENTRAL&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;SOUTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;CENTRAL&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;08:00&quot;,&quot;SOUTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;08:30&quot;,&quot;SOUTHERN&quot;\r\n&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;9:30&quot;,&quot;BAYVIEW&quot;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103734/aggregating-non-date-time-series-in-r","title":"aggregating non-date time series in r"},{"tags":["sql","azure-sql-database"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10567,"user_id":1322268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EfWtq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shawnt00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1322268/shawnt00"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433693,"post_id":58103733,"comment_id":102599055,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103733/inserting-a-date-into-a-table-adds-extra-timestamp-with-it#comment102599055_58103733"},{"owner":{"reputation":10567,"user_id":1322268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EfWtq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shawnt00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1322268/shawnt00"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433818,"post_id":58103733,"comment_id":102599108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103733/inserting-a-date-into-a-table-adds-extra-timestamp-with-it#comment102599108_58103733"},{"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":6143848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5813644c9fd650408b0509c623a1aba0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zaibi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6143848/zaibi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10567,"user_id":1322268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EfWtq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shawnt00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1322268/shawnt00"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569434163,"post_id":58103733,"comment_id":102599272,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103733/inserting-a-date-into-a-table-adds-extra-timestamp-with-it#comment102599272_58103733"},{"owner":{"reputation":10567,"user_id":1322268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EfWtq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shawnt00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1322268/shawnt00"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569435623,"post_id":58103733,"comment_id":102599852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103733/inserting-a-date-into-a-table-adds-extra-timestamp-with-it#comment102599852_58103733"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":6143848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5813644c9fd650408b0509c623a1aba0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zaibi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6143848/zaibi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569434661,"post_id":58103891,"comment_id":102599489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103733/inserting-a-date-into-a-table-adds-extra-timestamp-with-it/58103891#comment102599489_58103891"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6260,"user_id":3627756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxLDj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ankit Bajpai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3627756/ankit-bajpai"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569433267,"creation_date":1569433267,"answer_id":58103891,"question_id":58103733,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58103891","body_markdown":"There are few settings which sets by Oracle on your behalf.

it to not use bootstrap sampling, which would make it equivalent to the Random Subspace method; I have tried the combination of `replace=FALSE` and `sampsize=nrow(x)` in the [`randomForest` function][3], but it doesn&#39;t seem to work...\r\n\r\nAll in all, the message here (and arguably the reason why there is not a specific implementation of the method in R or other frameworks) is that, most probably, you will be better off sticking to Random Forests;

I am wondering here if it will be equivalent if I replace Conv2d by Conv1d, and change it to something like:\r\n```\r\n# Input dimension: BxNx3\r\n# not expanding dims this time\r\nnet = input_image\r\n\r\n# After 1st conv. dims:  BxNx3 --&gt; BxNx64\r\nnet = conv1d(net, 64, kernel_size=[1], stride=[1], ...)\r\n# After 2nd conv. dims:  BxNx64 --&gt; BxNx128\r\nnet = conv1d(net, 64, kernel_size=[1], stride=[1], ...)\r\n# ... and it goes on.\r\n```\r\n2. Coming from the first setting, I am also wondering if the conv. op. here is actually equivalent to some matrix multiplication/fully connected layer (as in tensorflow)/linear layer (as in torch):\r\n```\r\n# Reshape input dims: BxNx3 --&gt; (B*N)x3\r\n# so data entries in the batch are &quot;stacked together&quot;.\r\nnet = input_image.reshape(-1, 3)\r\n\r\n# I use torch.nn.linear() from pytorch here for easy explanation.\r\n# which basically does the follows:\r\n\r\n# After 1st linear:  (B*N)x3 --&gt; (B*N)x64\r\nnet = torch.nn.linear(net, in_feat=3, out_feat=64)\r\n# After 2nd linear:  (B*N)x64 --&gt; (B*N)x128\r\nnet = torch.nn.linear(net, in_feat=64, out_feat=128)\r\n# ... and it goes on.\r\n```\r\nI actually prefer the second setting, if it is correct, because the first dimension of input image can be replaced by something like (N_1+N_2+...+N_B) instead of B*N. This means that I do not have to fix every data entry to have the same size. Of course, it this setting is correct. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103687/choice-of-convolution-operator-in-spatial-transformation-networks-for-point-clou","title":"Choice of Convolution Operator in Spatial Transformation Networks for Point Clouds"},{"tags":["electron","electron-packager"],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":7356942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8a39695bce1ecd0c4f0cc9de0cfc607?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Torf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7356942/torf"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569432424,"creation_date":1569432424,"question_id":58103684,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58103684","body_markdown":"I have an Electron App that - when used - needs to be packed as asar.

The context you used comes from a widget above the RepositoryProvider.\r\n    2. You used MultiRepositoryProvider and didn&#39;t explicity provide the RepositoryProvider types.\r\n\r\n    Good: RepositoryProvider&lt;AppRepository&gt;(builder: (context) =&gt; AppRepository())\r\n    Bad: RepositoryProvider(builder: (context) =&gt; AppRepository()).\r\n\r\n    The context used was: BlocProvider&lt;RegisterBloc&gt;(dirty, state: _DelegateWidgetState#a87b2(lifecycle state: created))\r\n\r\nWhy am I getting this error? This problem seems to be fixed if I put the repository provider as the child of the blocprovider and app as the child repository provider in the main function and then deleting the invidual repository providers in App(). I&#39;m guessing the issue is from pushing the material page route from the button. I don&#39;t think I understand how context or provider exactly works in Flutter. I thought the provider would look up the widget tree for the repository/bloc, does pushing a route some how break this continuity? \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58103664/repository-provider-in-the-flutter-bloc-library-doesnt-provide-repository-with","title":"Repository provider in the flutter_bloc library doesn&#39;t provide repository with when pushing new route"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7594}
