\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nWhat I was hoping for was to have a number of buttons associated with each column (Button 1 &amp; 4 with column 1, 2 with 2 etc).  \r\n\r\nIf the user pressed button 1 2 times and button 4 3 times it would fill column 1 5 times. Then when button 2 was pressed it would fill column 2 but start in row 1 rather than a new 6th row same for button 3. \r\n\r\nSo in the end it would be a row where all 3 columns are filled in the row rather than just one column with two blanks. \r\n\r\nI did have it as labels that were added when a submit button was pressed but that meant that the buttons still had to be pressed in a sequence that filled column 1, 2 &amp; 3 before they were submitted \r\n\r\n\r\n[New Outcome][2]\r\n\r\nAny help or pointers greatly appreciated \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ef42N.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kDWC.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000775/adding-to-datagridview-by-column-or-cell","title":"Adding to DataGridView by column or cell"},{"tags":["datetime","pyspark"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568890654,"post_id":58000772,"comment_id":102423108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000772/does-pyspark-to-date-method-simply-truncates-a-datetime-to-a-date#comment102423108_58000772"},{"owner":{"reputation":1516,"user_id":2702370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbdef79714a99bcd92fc92f4c09ab821?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"crash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702370/crash"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568967490,"post_id":58000772,"comment_id":102451409,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000772/does-pyspark-to-date-method-simply-truncates-a-datetime-to-a-date#comment102451409_58000772"},{"owner":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568969473,"post_id":58000772,"comment_id":102452326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000772/does-pyspark-to-date-method-simply-truncates-a-datetime-to-a-date#comment102452326_58000772"},{"owner":{"reputation":1516,"user_id":2702370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbdef79714a99bcd92fc92f4c09ab821?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"crash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702370/crash"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4574,"user_id":8805315,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/391c509601d010c0ae3b15ca9197547b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pissall","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805315/pissall"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568971197,"post_id":58000772,"comment_id":102453220,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000772/does-pyspark-to-date-method-simply-truncates-a-datetime-to-a-date#comment102453220_58000772"}],"owner":{"reputation":1516,"user_id":2702370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbdef79714a99bcd92fc92f4c09ab821?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"crash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2702370/crash"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841056,"creation_date":1568841056,"question_id":58000772,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000772","body_markdown":"I wanted to use the [`to_date()`][1] method on some UTC datetime records to keep only the date part of it.\r\n\r\nAll it does is a truncation or it does something else?

But I recommend you to create a custom policy only has the Read access.\r\n2. if you use auto-generated kms key for your secret, you have to use ``aws kms create-grant`` command to grant the Lambda Function IAM Role to access the kms key for encryption, here&#39;s how https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/create-grant.html\r\n3. if you use custom kms key, you should be able to edit the user of your kms key, select the Lambda Function IAM Role in your aws console.\r\n\r\nHope this answers your question.\r\n\r\nIf this help, please Star my project https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/pysecret-project.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000751/using-aws-secrets-manager-with-python-lambda-console/58345245#58345245","title":"Using AWS Secrets Manager with Python (Lambda Console)"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":8156810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5266651514d744147a1a01cbbcb92a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jeff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8156810/jeff"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":119,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570824383,"creation_date":1568840956,"question_id":58000751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000751","body_markdown":"I am attempting to use Secrets Manager a Lambda function in AWS.

I&#39;d like to call one of my js initializer methods in ```document.ready()``` from inside the page that is displayed via my RenderAction call, but it seems to be triggering ```document.ready()``` before the html in the page after the ```Html.RenderAction()``` call. \r\n\r\nBecause of this, the init function is checking data from a kendo element that hasn&#39;t loaded since it&#39;s being called before JQuery finishes up, and only sees the inputs that should be kendo inputs as default html ```&lt;input&gt;``` elements.\r\n\r\nIn other words, is there a way to delay the loading / call of RenderAction until the page its inside of loads? Or should I just use some ugly CSS to keep the section I need at the top of my div? Very basic summary of my code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n  @Html.RenderAction(&quot;File that calls init() method&quot;)\r\n  &lt;...rest of page that I need to load first, including kendo text boxes/&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\nFile that calls init() method\r\n```\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\r\n  $(document).ready(function() {\r\n    myJs.init(params)\r\n  }\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNow that I&#39;ve gone to implement the answer below elsewhere, I&#39;ve realized that when switching from `document.ready` to `window.on(&#39;load&#39;,...)`, it&#39;s now broken another view that works similarly, but instead the ```@Html.RenderAction``` call is on the bottom:\r\n\r\n```&lt;html&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n  &lt;&gt;page including kendo inputs&lt;/&gt;\r\n  @Html.RenderAction(&quot;different file that calls same init() method&quot;)\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, ```document.ready``` works for me if the razor is before the kendo, but not the other way around - and ```window.on(&#39;load&#39;,function(){...})``` works for the opposite.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** I ended up having to just rearrange my page after a lot of trial and error looking for a fix for this - seems like there&#39;s no easy way around the order in which the razor loads on CSHTML pages","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000710/is-it-possible-to-control-the-order-in-which-html-razor-components-render","title":"Is it possible to control the order in which HTML Razor components render?"},{"tags":["jsf","primefaces"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4345,"user_id":865107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/86aFf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Selaron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/865107/selaron"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568881246,"creation_date":1568881246,"answer_id":58006684,"question_id":58000708,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006684","body_markdown":"In order to show the dimensions to the user, you don&#39;t need to update server side bean properties `cropWith` and `cropHeight`.

Additionally this would be much overhead creating a new `CroppedImage` instance on every user interaction.\r\n\r\nInstead you could do this via JavaScript and override an internal method of the `p:imageCropper` widget. This of course introduces the risk of failure with future versions of PrimeFaces and might require maintenance:\r\n\r\nSimply add (and understand) this JavaScript somewhere below the `p:imageCropper` and note that I have added a `id` and a `widgetVar` attribute to your `p:imageCropper`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;h:outputScript&gt;\r\n\r\n\t// tweak the image cropper as soon as the image has been loaded\r\n\t$(PrimeFaces.escapeClientId(&#39;frm1:imageCropper_image&#39;)).on(&#39;load&#39;,\r\n\t\tfunction() {\r\n\t\t\tvar cropper = PF(&#39;cropper&#39;);\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t// backup original saveCoords function\r\n\t\t\tcropper.saveCoordsOrig = cropper.saveCoords;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tcropper.saveCoords = function(box) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// invoke original function\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.saveCoordsOrig(box);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n                // update the dimension display:\t\r\n\t\t\t\t$(PrimeFaces.escapeClientId(&#39;frm1:newDimensions&#39;)).html(box.w + &#39; x &#39; + box.h);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n    &lt;/h:outputScript&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000708/primefaces-imagecropper-display-crop-region-dimensions/58006684#58006684","title":"PrimeFaces ImageCropper display crop region dimensions"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12087070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/734f0d3ba77ea5f3b37aadb19448fd1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BlackPuma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087070/blackpuma"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58006684,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568881246,"creation_date":1568840716,"question_id":58000708,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000708","body_markdown":"I am working on a jsf application to crop images using PrimeFaces 6.2 ImageCropper. I would like to display the dimensions of the cropping region (e.g. 500 x 500 pixels) as a text field below the image, and have the text field dimensions update appropriately as the user drags the edges of the region.\r\n\r\nMy approach to achieving this was to first create fields that maintain the values of the crop region dimensions in the ```cropBean```. Then add a ```valueChangeListener``` tag in the ImageCropper to trigger a method in the ```cropBean``` to update the crop region dimensions. Here&#39;s a small portion of the code I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\nXHTML Portion:\r\n```\r\n&lt;p:imageCropper value=&quot;#{cropBean.croppedImage}&quot;\r\n                    image=&quot;myImage.jpg&quot;\r\n                    initialCoords=&quot;0,0,#{cropBean.originalWidth}, #{cropBean.originalHeight}&quot;\r\n                    update=&quot;:mainContainer newDimensions&quot;\r\n                    valueChangeListener=&quot;#{cropBean.updateCropDimensions}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h:outputText id=&quot;newDimensions&quot;\r\n                value=&quot;New Dimensions: #{cropBean.cropWidth} x #{cropBean.cropHeight}&quot;\r\n                style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCropBean Portion:\r\n```\r\nprivate CroppedImage croppedImage;\r\nprivate int cropWidth = 0;\r\nprivate int cropHeight = 0;\r\n\r\npublic void updateCropDimensions() {\r\n\t\tcropWidth = croppedImage.getWidth();\r\n\t\tcropHeight = croppedImage.getHeight();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I&#39;ve also added getters and setters for the fields and verified that the cropping works)\r\n\r\nHowever the ```valueChangeListener``` does not seem to be calling the ```updateCropDimensions``` method.

And it is really hard to keep track of after some point, if you try to delete everything thinking you can create new migration files with ease, trust me as someone who experienced otherwise, it does not work like that. It is way simpler to let django handle the migration squashing, it optimizes the migration meaning that it also deletes the unused ones in your final state. \r\n\r\nMore to read at: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000680/django-safely-remove-old-migrations/58001056#58001056","title":"Django: Safely Remove Old Migrations?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1399,"user_id":364966,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ea2b8fe02ce7ee34472972214a3bef9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VikR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364966/vikr"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568937832,"creation_date":1568937832,"answer_id":58020173,"question_id":58000680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020173","body_markdown":"Having marked one of the answers provided previously as being accepted, here is a summary of a few things I learned:\r\n\r\n - Deleting Django migrations is generally a **bad idea**.\r\n - Django keeps track of what&#39;s in your db through these migration files, as well as through a table it creates in your db, and if you delete any of this Django will start throwing errors on `migrate` that can be hard to fix.\r\n\r\nI was getting some of those hard-to-fix errors. Here is what I did to fix it:\r\n\r\n- Ran `migrate` on the production server.\r\n- When I got an error, it would tell me how the db was out of sync with what Django expected. I corrected that manually by directly editing the db with an sql client. \r\n- E.g. If it said a key existed that wasn&#39;t supposed to exist, I deleted the relevant index from the indicated table.\r\n- Or if it said a table existed that wasn&#39;t supposed to exist, I backed up the table to a file, and deleted the table. `Migrate` then created the table, and then I repopulated it with data from the backup.\r\n- In the case of many-to-many tables, once Django had re-created them, I deleted all the new Django-created tables, and restored them from a backup created on my local dev system, which had already had all the latest migrations run on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually I was able to complete all migrations successfully. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling I lucked out and the above won&#39;t work in all cases! I&#39;ve learned a lot about Django and migrations and will be much more careful about this in the future.\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000680/django-safely-remove-old-migrations/58020173#58020173","title":"Django: Safely Remove Old Migrations?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1399,"user_id":364966,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ea2b8fe02ce7ee34472972214a3bef9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VikR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364966/vikr"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58000915,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568937832,"creation_date":1568840533,"question_id":58000680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000680","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got a Django app with a lot of out-of-date migrations.

It it reasonable to expect to be able to modify a CPLEX object in this way (or any other arbitrary python object)?  \r\n\r\nI am new to Ray so I may be structuring this all wrong, or maybe this will never work for X, Y, and Z reason which would also be good to know.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000663/using-python-ray-with-cplex-model-object","title":"Using Python Ray With CPLEX Model Object"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","rest","api","express"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1165,"user_id":9893154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ILwj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PerpetualJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9893154/perpetualj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568841092,"post_id":58000662,"comment_id":102407322,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000662/is-it-bad-practice-if-i-use-one-endpoint-to-monitor-another-endpoint#comment102407322_58000662"},{"owner":{"reputation":1297,"user_id":1806348,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7TqKN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jochem Kuijpers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1806348/jochem-kuijpers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568843441,"post_id":58000662,"comment_id":102408037,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000662/is-it-bad-practice-if-i-use-one-endpoint-to-monitor-another-endpoint#comment102408037_58000662"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10221141,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M0NL6BfnXn4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qa6dgy3BRceoSpWadu21N06R_fsg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tim Fei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10221141/tim-fei"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568840442,"creation_date":1568840442,"question_id":58000662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000662","body_markdown":"I have a web application with various endpoints, and I have to create a dashboard tool to monitor the statuses of those endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of my web application endpoint is `base-uri/api/v1/apple/`. \r\n\r\nOn my dashboard, I need to display whether the server status is up/down at that endpoint.

Please review the help guide for [ask]. Using that as a template for you question will normally give you a better chance of getting a satisfactory answer. \r\nHowever, in this case I can see what you after although there is a big omission: What happens when the status has reached &#39;Z&#39; and it time to update? More on that later. \r\nYour request has 2 components, actually getting a process to run and a rolling update procedure (script) for the status. Well Postgres has no native functionally for initiating a script. You&#39;ll have to setup a cron job, or an entry is what ever job scheduler you have. The update process is not all that difficult, except for the undefined &#39;Z&#39; status problem. (So when that happens I&#39;ll just repeat the A-Z extending the code length (sort of like excel names columns). The basic update needed is to simply add 1 to the current value. But of course the statement &quot; &#39;A&#39;+1 &quot; doesn&#39;t work, but the result can be obtained with the [CHR and ASCII][1] functions.

it or not, the problem you describe is equivalent to _computing the length of the longest increasing subsequence_. There&#39;s a neat little greedy idea as to why. \r\n\r\nConsider the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the array. Because the elements are ascending in index and also ascending in value, they must all be in different piles. As a result the minimum number of piles needed is equal to the number of elements in the LIS.\r\n\r\nLIS is easily solvable in `O(NlogN)` using dynamic programming and a binary search.\r\n\r\nNote that the algorithm you describe does the same thing as the algorithm below - it finds the first pile you can put the item on (with binary search), or it creates a new pile, so this serves as a &quot;proof&quot; of correctness for your algorithm and a way to reduce your complexity.\r\n\r\nLet `dp[i]` be equal to the minimum value element at the end of an increasing subsequence of length `(i + 1)`.

I have to place all of them such that I use the least number of piles. I can **not** place two weights in a pile where the one on top is greater than the one below. I also have to respect the ordering of the weights, so they must be placed in order. There is no height limit for the pile.\r\n\r\nAn example: If I have the weights {53, 21, 40, 10, 18} I cannot place 40 above 21 because the pile must be in descending order, and I cannot place 21 above 40 because that does not respect the order. An optimal solution would have pile 1: 53, 21, 10 and pile 2: 40 18\r\n\r\nMy general solution is iterate through the array and always pick the first pile the weight is allowed to go. I believe this would give me an optimal solution (although I haven&#39;t proved it yet). I could not find a counter example to this. But this would be O(n^2) because worst case I have to iterate through every element and every pile (I think)\r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to get this down to O(n) or O(nlogn)?

Since the `log` package always appends a new line to the end of every string written to the log, there is no way to append more text to the end of that line when using that Writer, even if you bring in a different type of Writer to do the appends. I ended up having to roll my own.\r\n\r\nPackage:\r\n\r\n    package mylogger\r\n\r\n    import (\r\n        &quot;os&quot;\r\n\t    &quot;bufio&quot;\r\n\t    &quot;time&quot;\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    var logWriter *bufio.Writer\r\n\r\n    func InitLogFile() (*os.File, error) {\r\n        logFile, err := os.Create(logPath)\r\n\t    if err != nil {\r\n\t\t    return nil, err\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\n\t    logWriter = bufio.NewWriter(logFile)\r\n\r\n\t    return logFile, nil\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func Print(msg string) {\r\n\t    if logWriter != nil {\r\n\t    \tlogWriter.WriteString(msg)\r\n\t\t    logWriter.Flush()\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func NewLine(msg string) {\r\n\t    if logWriter != nil {\r\n\t\t    logWriter.WriteString(&quot;\\n&quot; + time.Now().Format(&quot;2006/02/01 15:04:05&quot;) + &quot; &quot; + msg)\r\n\t\t    logWriter.Flush()\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMain program:\r\n\r\n    logFile, err := mylogger.InitLogFile()\r\n    defer logFile.Close()\r\n\r\n    mylogger.NewLine(&quot;Starting first round&quot;)\r\n    for i := 1; i &lt; 4; i++ {\r\n        request, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://www.someapi.com/pgNum=&quot; + i, nil)\r\n        response, err := client.Do(request)\r\n        mylogger.Print(&quot;.&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mylogger.NewLine(&quot;Starting second round&quot;)\r\n    for j := 1; j &lt; 4; j++ {\r\n        request, err := http.NewRequest(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://www.someotherapi.com/pgNum=&quot; + j, nil)\r\n        response, err := client.Do(request)\r\n        mylogger.Print(&quot;.&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mylogger.NewLine(&quot;Done&quot;)\r\n\r\nThis gets my desired result.\r\n\r\nImportant note: This only works because my program operates in a single thread and has a linear flow. If there were any concurrency where different subroutines could call into the logging function at any time, this would fall apart very quickly.\r\n\r\nThis is not my actual program, but an abbreviated gist of what it does. Error handling omitted for brevity.

When we set value-&gt;internalId to 1 it works.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to just pass in the string value?\r\n\r\nDoes not work:\r\n```php\r\n                $customField1 = new StringCustomFieldRef();\r\n                $customField1 -&gt;value = &quot;LTL&quot;;\r\n                $customField1 -&gt;scriptId = &#39;custitem_zu_zu_fulfill_pref&#39;;\r\n```\r\nWorks:\r\n```php\r\n                $customField1 = new StringCustomFieldRef();\r\n                $customField1 -&gt;value = &quot;1&quot;;\r\n                $customField1 -&gt;scriptId = &#39;custitem_zu_zu_fulfill_pref&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the error response:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;platformCore:statusDetail type=&quot;ERROR&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;platformCore:code&gt;INVALID_KEY_OR_REF&lt;/platformCore:code&gt;\r\n    &lt;platformCore:message&gt;Invalid custitem_zu_zu_fulfill_pref reference key LTL.&lt;/platformCore:message&gt;\r\n&lt;/platformCore:statusDetail&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000632/how-do-i-call-netsuite-suitetalk-inventoryitem-add-using-list-name-for-stringcus","title":"How do I call NetSuite SuiteTalk inventoryitem add using list name for StringCustomFieldRef value instead of internalID?"},{"tags":["python","opengl","vispy"],"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":3054726,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0a164722fa40106d2aaee5357bf6962?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdbrody","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3054726/jdbrody"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43551,"user_id":44729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyWaU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"genpfault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/44729/genpfault"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841960,"creation_date":1568840201,"last_edit_date":1568841960,"question_id":58000631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000631","body_markdown":"I am using Vispy to display some real-time signals, based on the example on the webpage.

Have others experienced this as well? \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have tried it with other values of gamma and received the same results indicating to me the gamma parameter is ignored, but I am looking for validation from others to see if they have similar answers and an explanation as to why Gamma is present.\r\n\r\n    library(e1071)\r\n    set.seed(1)\r\n    model&lt;-svm(Sepal.Length~Sepal.Width+Petal.Length,\r\n                data=iris,\r\n                kernel=&#39;linear&#39;,\r\n                cost=0.5,\r\n                epsilon=0.1,\r\n                cross=10\r\n    )\r\n    model\r\n    Parameters:\r\n       SVM-Type:  eps-regression \r\n     SVM-Kernel:  linear \r\n           cost:  0.5 \r\n          gamma:  0.5\r\n        epsilon:  0.1 \r\n    coef(model)\r\n    (Intercept)  Sepal.Width Petal.Length \r\n     -0.01487154   0.31124329   0.97591508 \r\n    modelG2&lt;-svm(Sepal.Length~Sepal.Width+Petal.Length,\r\n               data=iris,\r\n               kernel=&#39;linear&#39;,\r\n               cost=0.5,\r\n               epsilon=0.1,\r\n               gamma=2,\r\n               cross=10\r\n    )\r\n    modelG2\r\n    Parameters:\r\n       SVM-Type:  eps-regression \r\n     SVM-Kernel:  linear \r\n           cost:  0.5 \r\n          gamma:  2 \r\n        epsilon:  0.1 \r\n    coef(modelG2)\r\n    (Intercept)  Sepal.Width Petal.Length \r\n     -0.01487154   0.31124329   0.97591508 \r\n    \r\n    modelG17&lt;-svm(Sepal.Length~Sepal.Width+Petal.Length,\r\n                 data=iris,\r\n                 kernel=&#39;linear&#39;,\r\n                 cost=0.5,\r\n                 epsilon=0.1,\r\n                 gamma=17,\r\n                 cross=10\r\n    )\r\n    modelG17\r\n    coef(modelG17)\r\n    (Intercept)  Sepal.Width Petal.Length \r\n     -0.01487154   0.31124329   0.97591508\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/e1071.pdf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000614/linear-svm-with-gamma-parameter","title":"Linear SVM with Gamma Parameter"},{"tags":["haskell","stack-overflow"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1568840591,"post_id":58000613,"comment_id":102407156,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000613/why-does-mc-haskell-function-result-in-stack-overflow#comment102407156_58000613"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":true,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1568840363,"creation_date":1568840363,"answer_id":58000652,"question_id":58000613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000652","body_markdown":"The first expression\r\n\r\n    mc $ mc x+11\r\n\r\nis interpreted as\r\n\r\n    mc ((mc x) + 11)\r\n\r\nsince function application takes precedence over operators.\r\n\r\nThe second expression\r\n\r\n    mc $ mc (x+11)\r\n\r\nis interpreted as:\r\n\r\n    mc (mc (x+11))\r\n\r\nThe first indeed will never get evaluated, since if you write:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;mc x&lt;/b&gt; | x &amp;gt; 100 = x-10\r\n     | otherwise = mc (&lt;b&gt;(mc x)&lt;/b&gt; + 11)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nthen you define `mc x` in terms of `mc x`.

when its running on my local PC (both client and server) Everything works great. When I use another device some packets are lost and not executed. The client device is active all of the time and is sending the packets to the server. That is how 99% of the data transfers are taking place, from client to server. I dont understand why packets are not delivering at all.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000566/c-tcp-packets-lost-when-using-different-devices-but-not-on-local-machine","title":"C# TCP packets lost when using different devices but not on local machine"},{"tags":["visual-studio","tfs","azure-devops"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34064,"user_id":5391065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b615692abd82961458da80dd640f3300?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PatrickLu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5391065/patricklu-msft"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568877924,"creation_date":1568877924,"answer_id":58005819,"question_id":58000564,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58005819","body_markdown":"According to your screenshot, you may enter the wrong url or not select a project to connect. \r\n\r\nIn Azure DevOps service, there is **no need to add any collection in the url**, an organization is just kind of a collection--defaultcollection.

As NetMage points out, your first `.ToList()` call is a major issue. This is materializing the entire set to memory which means pulling all of that data from the DbServer to the web server. As far as I can see that was done just to get a count.\r\n\r\nUpdated code:\r\n\r\n    query = Context.SaleTransaction\r\n                   .Where(s =&gt; s.PayIn.Date &lt;= DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(6) \r\n                        &amp;&amp; s.Paid == false\r\n                        &amp;&amp; s.ProcessingPaid == false\r\n                        &amp;&amp; (s.Transaction.Status == TransactionStatus.Authorized || s.Transaction.Status == TransactionStatus.Paid) )\r\n                    .GroupBy(s =&gt; new { s.AdminSaleId, s.PayIn.Date });\r\n    var rowCount = query.Count();\r\n\r\n This will execute one query to get the count of groups without pulling back all of the data.\r\n\r\n2. When using projection (`Select`) You do not need to use the Include statements. Those only apply when retrieving the actual entity graph, such as during an Update.\r\n\r\n3. Next, once you calculate your paging figures from the Count:\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n    data.Data = await query.Select(s =&gt; new AdvanceIn()\r\n        {\r\n           Count = s.Count(),\r\n           NetAmountSum = s.Select(t =&gt; t.NetAmount).Sum(),\r\n           GrossAmountSum = s.Select(t =&gt; t.Transaction.GrossAmountWithoutSaleDiscount).Sum(),\r\n           AdminSale =  s.AdminSale.OrderBy(/* ?? */).Select(a =&gt; new SaleTransferReadModel \r\n           {\r\n               Id = a.Id,\r\n               PlaceName = a.PlaceName,\r\n               PlacePhoto = a.PlacePhoto\r\n           }).First(),\r\n           PayIn = s.Select(t =&gt; t.PayIn).First(), // Nope! don&#39;t return an Entity. Get a value or create a ViewModel like SaleTransferReadModel.\r\n           SaleTransactionId = String.Join(&quot;,&quot;, s.Select(x =&gt; x.Id.ToString())) // This might not work for EF2SQL... Consider returning the list of IDs and projecting to a Display String in the ViewModel.\r\n        }).OrderBy(s =&gt; s.PayIn)\r\n        .Skip(limit.Value * page)\r\n        .Take(limit.Value)\r\n        .ToListAsync();\r\n\r\nThis will run the second query to pull back just the selected page of data from the database. I&#39;d be considering using async here to allow your web server to process requests while this query is running as it might take a second or so depending on the data involved.\r\n\r\nKey changes/notes here: Don&#39;t repeat the `First` call to populate the inner view model. Project it with `Select` based on the First desired child record. When using `First` etc. you should always include an `OrderBy` because you cannot rely on any default ordering.\r\n\r\nNext, the code is embedding an Entity, PayIn. Either take a field from PayIn to return or project it into a ViewModel. You don&#39;t want to embed any entities in your view model because when the serializer goes to turn it into JSON or whatever, it will touch any properties on PayIn and potentially trip lazy-loads.\r\n\r\nLastly would be the `string.Join()` on the ID list. This *might* work, but it may not and EF core has a nasty habit of throwing up a warning that it&#39;s going to prematurely materialize a query to 2-step the projection which defeats the entire purpose. I would instead `Select` a `List&lt;string&gt;` of IDs into the view model, then expose an extra property on the view model that does a `string.Join()`.\r\n\r\n    public ICollection&lt;Guid&gt; SalesTransactionIds { get; set; } // Populate this in your Linq expression...\r\n        \r\n    public string DisplaySalesTransactionIds \r\n    {\r\n       get { return string.Join(&quot;,&quot;, SalesTransactionIds); }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n** note: If that gives you any grief about types, you can use `SalesTransactionIds.Select(x =&gt; x.ToString())` inside of the `Join`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the serializer crawls that, the view/grid should get a string property in the view&#39;s model called DisplaySalesTransactionIds which will give you the comma-delimited list.\r\n\r\nHave a go with some of those and see if it speeds things up a bit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000560/long-time-response-for-query-in-ef-core/58001275#58001275","title":"Long time response for query in ef core"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":5332064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/958434730883721/picture?type=large","display_name":"Thuran Eduardo Crespi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5332064/thuran-eduardo-crespi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568844119,"creation_date":1568839764,"question_id":58000560,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000560","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating a select for transactions when group us per user and date, and i need show totalizers also.

The server is working fine, but I need to stress-test it.  So I’ve built a client program to bombard it with simulated network requests.  Once the server is up and listening on TCP 12345, the client program just needs to do the following:\r\n\r\n - For N times, spin up a detached worker thread\r\n    - Each thread should open a sending socket, then send some data to 127.0.0.1, via TCP 12345\r\n   - After sending, a thread should immediately terminate\r\n\r\nThis should be child’s play.  I want to use large numbers of N to see what happens when my server is pounded.\r\n\r\nLet me walk you through my code, then describe the problem.  The program is relatively simple.  There&#39;s a few structs and then `main()`.  Basically, `main()` loops for N = `numThreads`, creating a detached worker thread each time.  Each thread is given a populated `package` struct, with information it will use later:\r\n\r\n    typedef struct{\r\n       int sock;\r\n       struct sockaddr address;\r\n       int addr_len;\r\n    } connection_t;\r\n    \r\n    typedef struct{\r\n       char* IP;\r\n       int port, myNum;\r\n    } package;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    void process(void* pack);                  // code for the thread, see below...\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    int main( int argc, char ** argv ){\r\n       pthread_t  thread;\r\n       int        numThreads = 10;             // or 100 or 1000 or whatever\r\n       char       svrIP[20] = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;\r\n       int        portNumber = 12345;\r\n    \r\n       int i=0;\r\n       for( ; i&lt;numThreads; i++){\r\n    \r\n          package* pack   = (package*) malloc( sizeof(package) );\r\n          pack-&gt;IP        = (char*) malloc( sizeof(char) * 20 );\r\n          strcpy( pack-&gt;IP, svrIP );\r\n          pack-&gt;port      = portNumber;\r\n          pack-&gt;myNum     = i;\r\n    \r\n          pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, process, (void*) pack);\r\n          pthread_detach(thread);\r\n    \r\n          free( pack-&gt;IP );\r\n          free( pack );\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       sleep(1);\r\n    \r\n       printf(&quot;END OF PROGRAM\\n&quot;);\r\n       return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEverything above works great, regardless of what I set for `numThreads`.  Now for the thread’s code.  Upon birth, the thread tries to open a socket and then send a text string.  Then the thread terminates.  Note all that `fprintf()` code around `gethostbyname()` – I’ll be referring to it later:\r\n\r\n    void process(void* pack){\r\n       int                  len, sock = -1;\r\n       struct sockaddr_in   address;\r\n       struct hostent *     host;\r\n    \r\n       char* msg = &quot;Some text string here for the server...&quot;;\r\n    \r\n       printf(&quot;THREAD %d STARTED:  %s  --  %d\\n&quot;, ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum, ((package*)pack)-&gt;IP, ((package*)pack)-&gt;port );\r\n    \r\n       // create the socket\r\n       sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);\r\n       if (sock &lt;= 0){\r\n          fprintf( stderr, &quot;Thread %d: error: cannot create socket\\n&quot;, ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum );\r\n          pthread_exit(0);\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       // connect to server\r\n       address.sin_family = AF_INET;\r\n       address.sin_port = htons( ((package*)pack)-&gt;port );\r\n       host = gethostbyname( ((package*)pack)-&gt;IP );\r\n       if (!host){\r\n          fprintf( stderr, &quot;Thread %d: error: unknown host %s  --  Error is:  (%d) \\”%s\\”\\n&quot;,\r\n                ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum,\r\n                ((package*)pack)-&gt;IP,\r\n                errno, strerror(errno));\r\n          pthread_exit(0);\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       memcpy(&amp;address.sin_addr, host-&gt;h_addr_list[0], host-&gt;h_length);\r\n       if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;address, sizeof(address))){\r\n          fprintf( stderr, &quot;Thread %d: error: cannot connect to host %s\\n&quot;, ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum, ((package*)pack)-&gt;IP );\r\n          pthread_exit(0);\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       printf(&quot;Thread %d: Sending message \\”%s\\”\\n&quot;, ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum, msg);\r\n    \r\n       len = strlen(msg);\r\n       write(sock, &amp;len, sizeof(int));\r\n       write(sock, msg, len);\r\n    \r\n       printf(&quot;Thread %d: message sent, exiting...\\n&quot;, ((package*)pack)-&gt;myNum );\r\n    \r\n       close(sock);\r\n    \r\n       pthread_exit(0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOkay, so that’s the code.  So here’s the issue:\r\n\r\nRegardless of what value I set for `numThreads`, some worker threads successfully open a socket, and some don’t.  The ones who fail are failing on that call to `gethostbyname()`.  Check out the below; I’ve set `numThreads` to 10, which means I should be seeing Threads 0 through 9 launch:\r\n\r\n    me@ubuntu:/home/me/socketProject# ./runTest\r\n    THREAD 2 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    THREAD 5 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    THREAD 3 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    THREAD 3 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    THREAD 4 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    THREAD 7 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    Thread 7: Sending message &quot;Some text string here for the server...&quot;\r\n    Thread 7: message sent, exiting...\r\n    THREAD 7 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    Thread 7: Sending message &quot;Some text string here for the server...&quot;\r\n    Thread 7: message sent, exiting...\r\n    THREAD 8 STARTED:  127.0.0.1  --  24601\r\n    Thread 8: Sending message &quot;Some text string here for the server...&quot;\r\n    Thread 8: message sent, exiting...\r\n    THREAD 9 STARTED:    --  24601\r\n    THREAD 9 STARTED:    --  24601\r\n    Thread 9: Sending message &quot;Some text string here for the server...&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: message sent, exiting...\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    Thread 9: error: unknown host   --  Error is:  (0) &quot;Success&quot;\r\n    END OF PROGRAM\r\n    me@ubuntu:/home/me/socketProject#\r\n\r\nThe server received four test messages, as the above output suggests.\r\n\r\nSooooooooo…  there’s a lot of weirdness happening here.  There must be some bug with those “**THREAD X STARTED**” messages, because it looks like Threads 0, 1, and 6 never launched, while somehow Threads 3, 7, and 9 launched twice.  But `numThreads` == 10 and ten threads started, so I’ll ignore that issue for now.\r\n\r\nOf greater concern is that six threads failed in their call to `gethostbyname()`.  I’ll admit: for this chunk of code, I copied an example from a textbook, and I can’t remember where I got it.  But I’m wondering if that `if(!host)` statement makes sense.  There was no problem when I beta tested this in the non-threaded version, but now…\r\n\r\nOf even bigger weirdness is that the Errno code is &quot;Success.&quot;  If its successful...  why is the call failing?  I feel like I&#39;m missing something really, really obvious.\r\n\r\nIt also bothers me that this problem is inconsistent.  Sometimes when I test this, 7/10 threads successfully send.  Sometimes 1/10 do.  My average success rate is about 3/10.  If I’ve learned anything about C, its that inconsistent problems usually indicate that a variables has been successfully created but not initialized.  What might need to be initialized here?  The `host` struct?  I’m not sure.\r\n\r\nI’ve been Googling this for about three hours now, but not pulling up anything useful.  Any suggestions or advice will be wildly appreciated. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000555/c-threads-inconsistently-open-a-sending-socket","title":"C :: Threads Inconsistently

to [the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/mix#environment-variables), you can use environment variables to inject parameters into Laravel Mix. Combine this with a custom script in your `package.json` and you get what you want.\r\n\r\nThe default `package.json` comes with the following two scripts (and more):\r\n```\r\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;npm run development&quot;,\r\n    &quot;development&quot;: &quot;cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSimply add your own script as a wrapper:\r\n```\r\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;npm run development&quot;,\r\n    &quot;dev:customer1&quot;: &quot;cross-env MIX_CUSTOMER=customer1 npm run dev&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n_Surely this works also with yarn..._\r\n\r\nIn your `webpack.mix.js`, you can then simply query the environment variable to only build a single customer:\r\n```\r\nconst mix = require(&#39;laravel-mix&#39;);\r\n\r\n// Parent Theme\r\nmix.js(&#39;resources/[parent-theme-folder]/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/[parent-theme-folder]/js/&#39;)\r\n  .sass(&#39;resources/[parent-theme-folder]/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/[parent-theme-folder]/css/&#39;);\r\n\r\nif (process.env.MIX_CUSTOMER === &#39;customer1&#39;) {\r\n    mix.js(&#39;resources/[child-theme-1-folder]/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/[child-theme-1-folder]/js/&#39;)\r\n      .sass(&#39;resources/[child-theme-1-folder]/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/[child-theme-1-folder]/css/&#39;);\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (process.env.MIX_CUSTOMER === &#39;customer2&#39;) {\r\n    mix.js(&#39;resources/[child-theme-2-folder]/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/[child-theme-2-folder]/js/&#39;)\r\n      .sass(&#39;resources/[child-theme-2-folder]/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/[child-theme-2-folder]/css/&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo simplify your `webpack.mix.js`, you can also do the following when using an environment variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst mix = require(&#39;laravel-mix&#39;);\r\n\r\n// Parent Theme\r\nmix.js(&#39;resources/[parent-theme-folder]/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/[parent-theme-folder]/js/&#39;)\r\n  .sass(&#39;resources/[parent-theme-folder]/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/[parent-theme-folder]/css/&#39;);\r\n\r\nfunction buildCustomerAssets(customerFolder)\r\n{\r\n    mix.js(`resources/${customerFolder}/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/${customerFolder}/js/&#39;)\r\n      .sass(&#39;resources/${customerFolder}/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/${customerFolder}/css/&#39;);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar customers = {\r\n    &#39;customer1&#39;: &#39;child-theme-1-folder&#39;,\r\n    &#39;customer2&#39;: &#39;child-theme-2-folder&#39;,\r\n};\r\n\r\nif (process.env.MIX_CUSTOMER) {\r\n    var customerFolder = customers[process.env.MIX_CUSTOMER];\r\n    buildCustomerAssets(customerFolder);\r\n} else {\r\n    for (const customerFolder of Object.values(customers)) {\r\n        buildCustomerAssets(folder);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause your parent theme uses the same folder structure, you could even compile it using the function.

I won&#39;t rehash their entire article and explain each line, but I&#39;ll include every line of code you&#39;ll need to duplicate my setup below.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nFirst, run ```npm install laravel-mix-merge-manifest```. This part is required if you want to use ```mix()``` in your views to find your css/js assets and enable cache-busting. Otherwise, every time you run ```npm run dev/watch/etc --theme=theme-name``` it&#39;s gonna overwrite the previous theme in your _mix-manifest.json_ file and you&#39;ll get Laravel errors that it can&#39;t find your assets. You&#39;ll actually use this package in your theme&#39;s mix files at the end.\r\n\r\nThen, delete everything in your _webpack.mix.js_ file in your root and paste this:\r\n\r\n    // webpack.mix.js\r\n    try {\r\n        require(`${__dirname}/webpack/webpack.${process.env.npm_config_theme}.mix.js`)\r\n    } catch (ex) {\r\n        console.log(\r\n            &#39;\\x1b[41m%s\\x1b[0m&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Provide correct --theme argument to build, e.g.: `npm run watch --theme=theme1` or `npm run dev --theme=theme2`&#39;\r\n        )\r\n        throw new Error(&#39;Provide correct --theme argument to build: `npm run watch --theme=theme1` or `npm run dev --theme=theme2`&#39;)\r\n    }\r\n    // ...that&#39;s it. Nothing is ever managed in this file.\r\n\r\nI tweaked this from the example in the article. I didn&#39;t like using an ```if()``` to search an array of all of your theme names because that was one more thing to have to update when you add/remove themes, so I&#39;m just using ```try {}``` which will output an error if it fails to find that theme&#39;s webpack.mix file. You could probably write something that would find and loop all your mix files and build everything at once, but that&#39;s not necessary in my use case, or performant when I have as many themes as I do.\r\n\r\nThen create a _/webpack/webpack.[theme].mix.js_ file for every theme. I put mine in a /webpack/ folder just because I didn&#39;t want to have 50+ of these files in my root. Note the /webpack/ folder is referenced in the 3rd line of the webpack.mix.js file above, so change that reference if you want it somewhere else. Here&#39;s an example of one of mine, but yours will obviously vary.\r\n\r\n    // /webpack/webpack.my-theme-1.mix.js\r\n    const mix = require(&#39;laravel-mix&#39;);\r\n    require(&#39;laravel-mix-merge-manifest&#39;);\r\n\r\n    mix.js(&#39;resources/my-theme-1/assets/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/my-theme-1/js/&#39;).sourceMaps().version()\r\n       .sass(&#39;resources/my-theme-1/assets/scss/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/my-theme-1/css/&#39;).sourceMaps().version()\r\n       .mergeManifest();\r\n\r\nNote the two references to the merge manifest. Those two things are required in each theme.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can run all of your usual build commands by passing in a --theme=[theme-name] argument, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    npm run dev --theme=my-theme-1\r\n    npm run watch --theme=my-theme-2\r\n    npm run prod --theme=my-parent-theme-1\r\n\r\nI personally split my terminal and run ```watch``` on both my child and parent themes as I&#39;m starting to build these out, but once my parent theme is stable I&#39;ll just have to watch my child themes.\r\n\r\nEverything&#39;s working great so far, but I&#39;m open to critique. Thanks to everyone for their help getting me on the right path.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.compulsivecoders.com/tech/how-to-build-multiple-vendors-using-laravel-mix/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000550/laravel-mix-build-process-scalable-up-to-lots-of-50-themes/58033808#58033808","title":"Laravel Mix build process scalable up to lots of (50+) themes"}],"owner":{"reputation":1209,"user_id":783300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yY28B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783300/michael"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1209,"user_id":783300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yY28B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/783300/michael"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58033808,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569006063,"creation_date":1568839699,"last_edit_date":1569006063,"question_id":58000550,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58000550","body_markdown":"**Is there a standard way to scale Laravel Mix to support a build process of 50+ different frontend themes?**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m simply running ```npm run dev``` and ```npm run watch``` currently with four different themes in my webpack.mix.js file, and that goes through and builds/watches all of those themes at once, but I fear performance is going to break down when we go to scale.

They each have their own child theme that extends the parent theme for that product to add any custom layouts, styles, views, etc. We felt one Laravel project was going to be easier to manage than setting up 20-30 different Laravel projects for each client, especially when it came to managing maintenance and updates.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/igaster/laravel-theme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000550/laravel-mix-build-process-scalable-up-to-lots-of-50-themes","title":"Laravel Mix build process scalable up to lots of (50+) themes"},{"tags":["html","css"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3351,"user_id":1291935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6c0d80f8d0f580c5e1fcb208c02874d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DrCord","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1291935/drcord"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568840162,"post_id":58000578,"comment_id":102407013,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000548/targeting-an-element-using-the-not-pseudoclass/58000578#comment102407013_58000578"},{"owner":{"reputation":416,"user_id":1258094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be809172c4ec9873153de8a829119ff8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justinraczak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1258094/justinraczak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568845738,"post_id":58000578,"comment_id":102408593,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000548/targeting-an-element-using-the-not-pseudoclass/58000578#comment102408593_58000578"},{"owner":{"reputation":11580,"user_id":4642212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dS8ne.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sebastian Simon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4642212/sebastian-simon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":416,"user_id":1258094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be809172c4ec9873153de8a829119ff8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justinraczak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1258094/justinraczak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568846451,"post_id":58000578,"comment_id":102408783,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000548/targeting-an-element-using-the-not-pseudoclass/58000578#comment102408783_58000578"},{"owner":{"reputation":416,"user_id":1258094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be809172c4ec9873153de8a829119ff8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justinraczak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1258094/justinraczak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568846896,"post_id":58000578,"comment_id":102408882,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000548/targeting-an-element-using-the-not-pseudoclass/58000578#comment102408882_58000578"},{"owner":{"reputation":17174,"user_id":804867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/505165583/picture?type=large","display_name":"hungerstar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/804867/hungerstar"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568999479,"post_id":58000578,"comment_id":102467426,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000548/targeting-an-element-using-the-not-pseudoclass/58000578#comment102467426_58000578"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11580,"user_id":4642212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dS8ne.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sebastian Simon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4642212/sebastian-simon"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1568839890,"creation_date":1568839890,"answer_id":58000578,"question_id":58000548,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000578","body_markdown":"Use `:not(#beginning) &gt; h4.small` instead.

I got what I needed by linking my Entities together with @OneToOne and @OneToMany annotations.\r\n\r\nNow im facing a new problem. Inside a function in a single service, I am saving two separate lists of entities. One list saves, and the other list fails due to a Unique Key Constraint Violation. This is expected to fail since im testing.\r\n\r\nBut, I have not figured out how to annotate my Service or method with @Transactional, so that when the second list fails to save, it will also roll back any successful saves of the first list.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW, rollbackFor = Exception.class)\r\n    protected void saveLists() {\r\n        List&lt;Object&gt; list1 = this.repository.getListOne();\r\n        List&lt;Object&gt; list2 = this.repository.getListTwo();\r\n\r\n        //Loop through list one and do some manipulation\r\n        //Loop through list two and do some manipulation\r\n\r\n        this.repository.saveAll(list1); // this saves all successfully\r\n        this.repository.saveAll(list2); // this has unique key exception\r\n\r\n        // rollback both list1 and list2 changes\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the data from list1 gets saved successfully and appears in the database after the exception from list2 is thrown. \r\n\r\nI thought that since they are in the same service and the same method, using the same repository, that they would be using the same transaction, and that Hibernate would not commit the transaction until it leaves this method with no errors.\r\n\r\nBut that does not seem to be the case. As the data for list one is getting committed and not rolled back. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am missing about the @Transactional annotation?\r\nHow can I make both saves work as a single transaction and rollback both, upon an error thrown from either save?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58000528/spring-boot-hibernate-rollback-successful-save-upon-exception","title":"Spring Boot - Hibernate, Rollback successful save upon exception"},{"tags":["regex"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1913,"user_id":1923633,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U1xiE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wolfgang Radl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1923633/wolfgang-radl"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841686,"creation_date":1568841686,"answer_id":58000873,"question_id":58000527,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000873","body_markdown":"There sure is: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.insert?view=netframework-4.8.
