In addition,\r\n&gt; the effects of altering inheritance are subtle and far-flung, and are\r\n&gt; not limited to simply the time spent in the Object.setPrototypeOf(...)\r\n&gt; statement, but may extend to any code that has access to any object\r\n&gt; whose [[Prototype]] has been altered.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Because this feature is a part of the language, it is still the burden\r\n&gt; on engine developers to implement that feature performantly (ideally).\r\n&gt; Until engine developers address this issue, if you are concerned about\r\n&gt; performance, you should avoid setting the [[Prototype]] of an object.\r\n&gt; Instead, create a new object with the desired [[Prototype]] using\r\n&gt; Object.create().\r\n\r\nPerformance comparsion (Feb 14 2019):\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/calebmer/c74e2a7941044e5f28b8#gistcomment-2836415\r\n\r\nIn short it looks like using `Object.create` **is much faster** then `Object.setPrototypeOf` when used at *extremely* larger scale.\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways to *to set the prototype of an object* in JS (like unrecommended use of `Object.prototype.__proto__` ) but nowadays (Oct 2019) the most recommended way seems to be the use of ES6 `class`, [supported][2] by most modern browsers. While there are benchmarks (like: [this][3]) that indicates that ES6 classes and `super()` are slower than thier ES5 counterparts, it makes your code cleaner especially for people from other OOP languages. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf\r\n  [2]: https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class\r\n  [3]: http://incaseofstairs.com/six-speed/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377377/extends-object-setprototypeof-vs-object-create/58473604#58473604","title":"Extends Object.setPrototypeOf() vs Object.create"}],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":11855662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rP1Hg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jesus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11855662/jesus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":11855662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rP1Hg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jesus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11855662/jesus"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571586756,"creation_date":1571057894,"last_edit_date":1571058366,"question_id":58377377,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377377","body_markdown":"I know two ways to inherit function constructor.\r\n\r\nOption 1 **Object.create**\r\n\r\n    function x(x, y) {\r\n      this.x = x;\r\n      this.y = y;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    x.prototype.XDD = function() {};\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    function y(c, r) {\r\n      x.call(this, 1, 2);\r\n      this.r = r;\r\n      this.c = c;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    y.prototype = Object.create(x.prototype);\r\n    y.prototype.YDD = function() {};\r\n    y.prototype.XDD = function() {};\r\n    y.prototype.constructor  = y;\r\n    \r\n    var rect = new y(1, 2);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOption 2 **Object.setPrototypeOf()**\r\n\r\n    function x(x, y) {\r\n      this.x = x;\r\n      this.y = y;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    x.prototype.XDD = function() {};\r\n    \r\n    function y(c, r) {\r\n      x.call(this, 1, 2);\r\n      this.r = r;\r\n      this.c = c;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    y.prototype.YDD = function() {};\r\n    y.prototype.XDD = function() {};\r\n    Object.setPrototypeOf(y.prototype, x.prototype);\r\n    \r\n    var rect = new y(1, 2);\r\n\r\nWhat are the differences between them ?.And there is another solution better than these ?.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377377/extends-object-setprototypeof-vs-object-create","title":"Extends Object.setPrototypeOf() vs Object.create"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":604,"user_id":1144542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/016999e57a592e8b4fd4973a2e2d5c22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chuck Adams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144542/chuck-adams"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571058914,"post_id":58377375,"comment_id":103103872,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377375/how-do-i-properly-refer-to-the-stones-weight-in-this-code#comment103103872_58377375"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6103,"user_id":4956907,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ypfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"michalk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4956907/michalk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571058324,"post_id":58377488,"comment_id":103103571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377375/how-do-i-properly-refer-to-the-stones-weight-in-this-code/58377488#comment103103571_58377488"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478,"user_id":11928088,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfd5f5ed70a37e684199988a6973e4da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrei Tigau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11928088/andrei-tigau"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571058258,"creation_date":1571058258,"answer_id":58377488,"question_id":58377375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58377488","body_markdown":"Stone and probably, the weight attribute in the Stone class are private.

It was slated to begin earlier this year, but the prerequisite refactor of the semantic analysis phase (which made a lot of the internal changes needed to cleanly support recursive types) ended up taking longer than expected, so I&#39;m not sure what the new timeline is. Maybe sometime in the next half-year or so? \r\n\r\nA possible alternative approach you could look into is to use [TypedDicts](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/more_types.html#typeddict), which let you assign specific types to certain keys. This is particularly useful if you already know ahead of time what the structure of your input dicts will be -- if you know exactly what keys your ObjectTypes will have, and precisely what they&#39;ll map to. Libraries like [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) are also helpful here, if you prefer working with objects over dicts and prefer not to have to write a bunch of validation logic.\r\n\r\nPragmatically though, if your dict structure is genuinely free-form, it might be best to just go with `ObjectType = Dict[str, object]`. After all, in order to identify exactly which EntryType you&#39;re dealing with, you&#39;re going to have to add in a few isinstance checks anyways to appropriate narrow the type. So, while starting off with `object` instead of `Union[str, ListType, ObjectType]` will be mildly annoying, it might not be too huge of an imposition depending on what you&#39;re doing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377361/how-can-i-make-a-recursive-python-type-defined-over-several-aliases/58383852#58383852","title":"How can I make a recursive Python type defined over several aliases?"}],"owner":{"reputation":14637,"user_id":229686,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6ce612702a34f9bcebee2f34139c3f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"edA-qa mort-ora-y","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/229686/eda-qa-mort-ora-y"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58383852,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571085939,"creation_date":1571057835,"question_id":58377361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377361","body_markdown":"I want this logical type structure:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nObjectType = Dict[str, &#39;EntryType&#39;]\r\nListType = List[&#39;EntryType&#39;]\r\nEntryType = Union[str, &#39;ListType&#39;, &#39;ObjectType&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mypy` reports these errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmdl/structure.py:7: error: Cannot resolve name &quot;ObjectType&quot; (possible cyclic definition)\r\nmdl/structure.py:7: error: Cannot resolve name &quot;EntryType&quot; (possible cyclic definition)\r\nmdl/structure.py:8: error: Cannot resolve name &quot;ListType&quot; (possible cyclic definition)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there some way to encode this recursive data type?\r\n\r\n_I believe I can inline the individual types, typing out the full definition each time, to allow recursion.

It always fails stating `Error:(3,33) java: package in.org.app.independent.bo does not exist` .\r\n\r\nI am providing the GitHub URL for the test project , if you want to take a look and test by yourself. \r\n\r\n**GIT URL:** \r\n\r\n&gt; https://github.com/DhruboB/testmultimodule\r\n\r\nI have tried all sort of tweaking found in internet so far e.g. \r\nclearing Intellij Cache &amp; restarting, mvn -U clean install, mvn scope verification, proxy etc. \r\n\r\nAny further idea to resolve this?

Existing solutions however seem more ore less messy to me. \r\n\r\nOne of the packages contains moste of the problems logic for example and the others contain auxiliray functionality such as plotting and data export. The logic package needs to stay slim and can not import more than `numpy` where as the other packages can utilise more complex packages like `pandas` and `matplolib`. **I would like to set up a package structure which looks like** the resulting namespace of a namespace package but without unnecessary folder nesting something like **this:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace\r\n├── logic\r\n│&#160;&#160;  ├── __init__.py\r\n|    ├──  functions.py\r\n│&#160;&#160;  └──  setup.py # requires numpy    \r\n├── datastructure\r\n│    ├── __init__.py\r\n|    ├──  functions.py\r\n│    └──  setup.py # requires namespace.logic and pandas\r\n├── plotting\r\n│    ├── __init__.py\r\n|    ├──  functions.py\r\n│    └──  setup.py # requires namespace.logic, namespace.datastructure and matplotlib\r\n└── setup.py #should install every package in namespace\r\n```\r\n\r\nI figured that this looks like a conventional package with modules but I did not find a way yet to set it up as a packgae while mainintainign the option to only install specific modules therefore I assumed a namespace package should offer that option but I can not quite get it to work with `pip`\r\n\r\nAt the moment I would be required to have two more directory levels like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace\r\n├── NamespaceLogic          #don&#39;t want this\r\n│&#160;&#160; ├── namespace           #don&#39;t want this\r\n│&#160;&#160; │&#160;&#160; └── logic\r\n│&#160;&#160; │&#160;&#160;     └── __init__.py\r\n│&#160;&#160; └── setup.py\r\n├── NamespaceDatastructure  #don&#39;t want this\r\n│   ├── namespace           #don&#39;t want this\r\n│   │   └── datastructure\r\n│   │       └── __init__.py\r\n│   └── setup.py\r\n├── NamespacePlotting       #don&#39;t want this\r\n│&#160;&#160; ├── namespace           #don&#39;t want this\r\n│&#160;&#160; │&#160;&#160; └── plotting\r\n│&#160;&#160; │&#160;&#160;     └── __init__.py\r\n│&#160;&#160; └── setup.py\r\n└── setup.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nMy problem is similar to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58134808/python-pip-install-sub-package-from-own-package?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1#58167603 but I would like to avoid having to many subfolders as this poses the risk to max out the path length restrictions of my system (+ it confuses everyone else).

I have a bunch of components that look like this:\r\n[![component description][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI want the following behaviour:\r\n\r\n - when on `Component A`, depending on the choice of my radiobutton,\r\n   `Component B` or `Component C` should render when I click the next\r\n   button\r\n - when on `Component B`, I should be able to render `Component A` by pressing the back button.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have a master component that contains a few things:\r\n- an enum `ComponentName` containing all of the names of my components\r\n- a `Map&lt;string, ReactNode&gt;` that contains a mapping from all of the componentnames to actual component instances.\r\n- a useState hook: `const [currentComponent, setCurrentComponent] = useState&lt;ComponentName&gt;(ComponentName.startComponent)`\r\n\r\nFinally, my master component has a `render` function that simply does:\r\n`&lt;&gt;{componentMap.get(currentComponent.toString())}&lt;/&gt;`\r\n\r\nThis *works* but this seems like a very verbose and tedious way of doing things. In order to maintain/change things, I must:\r\n- first work out which constants to change (i.e. the order of the components)\r\n- ensure that the transitions between components are not broken (this is error-prone as I might not test everything manually)\r\n\r\nIs there a better way of achieving the same behaviour? I would especially like it if I could declare each of my components independently and not have a master component like I have now.\r\n\r\nEdit: There is a question about desired end result. The context of all of this is that this is a wizard that users must go through before submitting something through a form.

The script is able to connect to the API and query the data successfully. The returned `status_code` is 200.\r\n\r\nNext the script tries to use the returned data from the source device and copy it to the destination device:\r\n\r\n    payload = response.json()\r\n    \r\n    dst_URL = &#39;https://172.16.2.101:4444/api/objects/http/exception&#39;\r\n    dst_headers = {\r\n            &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Accept&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Basic dG9rZW46dlZ3WnVZZGxpd01IRkxNVXpKVXZtZXhiZGZHSExobnI=&#39;\r\n            }\r\n    update =  requests.post(dst_URL, headers=dst_headers, json=payload, timeout=15, verify=False)\r\n    \r\n    result = update.content\r\n    print (result)\r\n\r\nNo error is returned but it&#39;s not working and the print statement returns this:\r\n\r\n    b&#39;[]&#39;\r\n\r\nSo basically, it seems that the content of `update` is empty, and is a byte for some reason.\r\n\r\nWhy does the content of `update` is empty? I would expect it to contain the returned data in JSON format.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nOK I think I figured out why it&#39;s not working as I expect.

However, notice that the error message is wrapped in a call to `self.gettext()` - this is to allow for message translations, and there is a CZ translation available.\r\n\r\nThe translation object is passed to the form fields from the `Form` object, so you can either set the translation on a per-instance basis, or for all forms using class inheritance.\r\n\r\n**Translating on a per-form basis**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom wtforms import DateField, Form\r\nfrom werkzeug.datastructures import MultiDict\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyForm(Form):\r\n    user_birth = DateField(&#39;Datum

[&#39;Neplatn&#225; hodnota pro datum.&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Translating with common base class:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass BaseForm(Form):\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        locales = [&#39;cs_CZ&#39;]\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyForm(BaseForm):\r\n    user_birth = DateField(&#39;Datum narozen&#237;&#39;, format=&#39;%d-%m-%y&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n

But I&#39;m having a problem that it seems like the car never learn anyhing (Even after 1000000 Episodes)\r\nSince I really can&#39;t figure out where my problem lies, I am posting most of the code (that I think could be relevant for the question).\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I have a Car class, and a Game class as my project structure. The game is built up using PyGame, and is basically \r\na grid with a fixed tilesize of 16px. For faster learning, a simple collison matrix has been made to save up runtime rather than using sprite collions. \r\nI have also implemented various reward systems to encourge the car to move in a specific direction, which can be seen below. (Breadcrumbs and rewarding the Car for not staying in the same position over a long time)\r\n\r\n&gt; One thing to note is that the car&#39;s movement is implementended in such a way  that it&#39;s not locked to the grid (for a smoother movement). However, the position of the car is mapped to the grid by dividing the position to the gridsize.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the game can be seen below:\r\n[![The Car Game][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe q-table that I use is the same size as this grid, with the amount of possible movements on every tile, defined as follows:\r\n\r\n\tfor x in range(0, int(GRIDWIDTH)+1):\r\n                for y in range(0, int(GRIDHEIGHT)+1):\r\n                        q_table[(y,x)] = [np.random.uniform(-5, 0) for i in range(NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS)]\r\n\r\nwhere I&#39;ve changed the NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS from either only letting the Car turn, with a constant speed forward. But also letting the Car go forward as an action.\r\n** Worth noting is that when using user inputs, all these actions works as intended.\r\nThe action function in the Car class is written like this:\r\n\r\n    def action(self, choice):\r\n        self.rot_speed = 0\r\n        if choice == 0:\r\n            #self.move(x=1, y=0)\r\n            self.rot_speed = PLAYER_ROT_SPEED\r\n            self.rot = (self.rot + self.rot_speed * self.game.dt)\r\n        elif choice == 1:\r\n            #self.move(x=-1, y=0)\r\n            self.rot_speed = -PLAYER_ROT_SPEED\r\n            self.rot = (self.rot + self.rot_speed * self.game.dt)\r\n        elif choice == 2:\r\n            self.vel = vec(PLAYER_SPEED, 0).rotate(-self.rot + ROTATE_SPRITE_DEG)\r\n    \r\n        If NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS == 2\r\n\t    self.vel = vec(PLAYER_SPEED, 0).rotate(-self.rot + ROTATE_SPRITE_DEG)\t\r\n        \r\n        self.pos += self.vel * self.game.dt\r\n        \r\n\r\nAnd the Q-learning algorithm is as follows (not that its being called in a loop for every episode).\r\n    \r\n    def qLearning(self):\r\n\t#Random Starting Positons on EVERY EPISODE\r\n        StartingPositions = self.playerPositions[np.random.randint(0,len(self.playerPositions))]\r\n        self.player = Player(self, StartingPosition[0] * TILESIZE , StartingPosition[1] * TILESIZE)\r\n        food = self.goal\r\n\r\n        episode_reward = 0\r\n\t\r\n\t#RESET BREADCRUMBS FOR EVERY EPISODE\r\n        for bread in range(len(self.breadCrumb_array)):\r\n            self.wallPositions[self.breadCrumb_array[bread][0]][self.breadCrumb_array[bread][1]] = 3\r\n\r\n        self.breadCrumb_array = []\r\n        self.lastPosition = self.player.posToTile\r\n        self.update()\r\n        self.dt = 0.1\r\n\r\n        for i in range(ITERATIONS):\r\n            obs = (int(self.player.posToTile.x), int(self.player.posToTile.y))\r\n            if np.random.random() &gt; self.epsilon:\r\n                action = np.argmax(self.q_table[obs])\r\n            else:\r\n                action = np.random.randint(0, NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS)\r\n\r\n            self.player.action(action)\r\n            self.update()\r\n\r\n            if not LEARNING:\r\n                self.draw()\r\n\r\n            if(self.wallPositions[int(self.player.posToTile.x)][int(self.player.posToTile.y)] == 1):\r\n                self.player.hitWall = True\r\n            elif(self.wallPositions[int(self.player.posToTile.x)][int(self.player.posToTile.y)] == 2):\r\n                self.player.hitGoal = True\r\n            elif (self.wallPositions[int(self.player.posToTile.x)][int(self.player.posToTile.y)] == 3):\r\n                self.wallPositions[int(self.player.posToTile.x)][int(self.player.posToTile.y)] = 0\r\n                self.breadCrumb_array.append((int(self.player.posToTile.x),int(self.player.posToTile.y)))\r\n                self.player.hitReward = True\r\n\r\n\r\n            if self.player.hitWall:\r\n                reward = -DEATH_PENALTY\r\n            elif self.player.hitGoal:\r\n                reward = FOOD_REWARD\r\n            elif self.player.hitReward:\r\n                reward = BREADCRUMB_REWARD\r\n                self.player.hitReward = False\r\n            else:\r\n                reward = -MOVE_PENALTY #+ self.distanceTo((player.pos), food)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n            if i % 100 == 0 and not i == 0 and not reward == -DEATH_PENALTY or reward == FOOD_REWARD:\r\n\t\t# Checks how far the distance is between the last position and current.\r\n                distance = self.distanceTo(self.lastPosition, self.player.posToTile)\r\n                self.lastPosition = self.player.posToTile\r\n                if (distance &gt; RADIUS):\r\n                    if (distance &lt;= 5):\r\n                        reward += distance\r\n                    else:\r\n                        reward += 5\r\n\r\n\r\n            new_obs = (int(self.player.posToTile.x), int(self.player.posToTile.y))\r\n            max_future_q = np.max(self.q_table[new_obs])\r\n\r\n            current_q = self.q_table[obs][action]\r\n\r\n            if reward == FOOD_REWARD:\r\n                new_q = FOOD_REWARD\r\n            elif reward == -DEATH_PENALTY:\r\n                new_q = -DEATH_PENALTY\r\n            else:\r\n                new_q = (1 - LEARNING_RATE) * current_q + LEARNING_RATE * (reward + DISCOUNT * max_future_q)\r\n\r\n            self.q_table[obs][(action)] = new_q\r\n\r\n            episode_reward += reward\r\n\r\n            if reward == FOOD_REWARD or reward == -DEATH_PENALTY:\r\n                break\r\n\t\r\n\t#For plotting later        \r\n\tself.episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)\r\n\tself.epsilon *= EPS_DECAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen running the q-learning, I have tried changing all the constans to different values in order to get a better result, however, the results seems\r\nto stay the same, i.e not learning anything. Over the night I tried with the following constants,\r\n\t\r\n\tITERATIONS = 5000\r\n\tHM_EPISODES = 1000000\r\n\tMOVE_PENALTY = 1\r\n\tDEATH_PENALTY = ITERATIONS * 2\r\n\tFOOD_REWARD = ITERATIONS\r\n\tRADIUS = 10\r\n\tBREADCRUMB_REWARD = 300\r\n\tEPS_DECAY = (1 - 1/(HM_EPISODES))\r\n\r\n\tLEARNING_RATE = 0.8 \r\n\tDISCOUNT = 0.95    \r\n\tEPSILON_START = 1       \r\n                        \r\nbut as can seen in the graph below, eventhough with a epilon that is decaying (almost reaching 0) the avg result never gets better (even worse).\r\n\r\n[![Graph over the Episode Rewards][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, despite from the various reward systems, I&#39;ve also tried using rays casts which depending on how close the car is to the a wall, the reward for that iteration gets affected, however this implementation did not seem to do any difference. Therefore, because of the heavy computation time of using the sprite collision, I&#39;m not using that code anymore.\r\n\r\nSo since it seems like I&#39;ve tried everything, and not succeeding in anyway, I was hoping that maybe anyone of you could see where my problem lies.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance, and I hope that i provided enough information about the problem.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Edit POST**: Since this question was posted, a work around was made. What I did to make the agent work as inteded I changed the movement from being &quot;Car Like&quot; to be block movement. This made the agent learn properly. So if anyone else ever \r\nhave this same issue, look to your movement or you enviourment and see if it&#39;s too complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HIoaK.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIRnR.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377239/self-driving-car-not-improving-with-q-learning","title":"Self-driving car not improving with Q-Learning"},{"tags":["javascript","cypress"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5984,"user_id":3975309,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5v7W.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikkel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3975309/mikkel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571070472,"post_id":58377238,"comment_id":103109773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377238/cypress-how-to-handle-erors#comment103109773_58377238"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":969,"user_id":11079356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Wsta7T1ME30/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNNha-cLoNgU-cv5aMI5g8K1zZVzQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mr. J.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11079356/mr-j"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571119875,"creation_date":1571119875,"answer_id":58388224,"question_id":58377238,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58388224","body_markdown":"As Mikkel mentioned already Cypress doesn&#39;t like optional testing.

But I don&#39;t like that idea at all.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m hoping someone with a better understanding of ES6 can help me with this\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/split-chunks.html\r\n  [2]: https://railsware.com/blog/how-to-analyze-circular-dependencies-in-es6/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377228/worried-about-circular-references-in-ecmascript-2015-modules","title":"Worried about circular references in EcmaScript 2015 modules"},{"tags":["tomcat","url-rewriting","tomcat-valve"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15388,"user_id":276232,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7dd5b284cb4046a3f3dd0ede614e12a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher Schultz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/276232/christopher-schultz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571431829,"post_id":58377220,"comment_id":103253018,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377220/tomcat-8-0-valve-rewrite-rule-ignored#comment103253018_58377220"}],"owner":{"reputation":127,"user_id":365716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36714bd02b9802b2b8cb1839a656fe01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohamed Abbas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/365716/mohamed-abbas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":38611,"user_id":13447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K6sTa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olaf Kock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13447/olaf-kock"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571310806,"creation_date":1571057360,"last_edit_date":1571310806,"question_id":58377220,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377220","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to achieve this redirect but it&#39;s not working.\r\n\r\nRule:\r\n\r\n    RewriteRule ^/docs/config(\\\\) /?test=test\r\n\r\nTest URI:\r\n\r\n    http://localhost:8080/docs/config/\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n    http://localhost:8080?test=test\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377220/tomcat-8-0-valve-rewrite-rule-ignored","title":"Tomcat 8.0 Valve Rewrite rule ignored"},{"tags":["javascript","class","oop","model"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":10226142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f380448019d2c49e06071a475232c52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"echebbi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10226142/echebbi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571057656,"post_id":58377215,"comment_id":103103192,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377215/best-practice-of-javascript-class-method-definition-to-calc-food-price-with-topp#comment103103192_58377215"},{"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571057657,"post_id":58377215,"comment_id":103103194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377215/best-practice-of-javascript-class-method-definition-to-calc-food-price-with-topp#comment103103194_58377215"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571065483,"creation_date":1571065483,"answer_id":58379467,"question_id":58377215,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58379467","body_markdown":"# Decorator pattern\r\n\r\nOK, so this is the job of the [decorator design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) - you can *wrap* your objects in another that decorates them with extra behaviour. This solves the problem of convoluted dependency hierarchies. You&#39;ve already experienced it but just to illustrate it - let&#39;s say you have \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Rament {}\r\nclass RamenWithPork extends Ramen {}\r\nclass RamenWithChicken extends Ramen {}\r\nclass RamenWithMushrooms extends Ramen {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you have `RamenWithChickenAndMushroom`? Do you extend `RamenWithChicken` or `RamenWithMushrooms` or just `Ramen`? What if you have `RamenWithPorkMushroomsAndChicken`? First of all, can you even remember the name of this class - if you sit down a day later, can you remember if it was pork, chicken and mushrooms or pork, mushrooms and chicken? Second how do you model that in the class hierarchy?\r\n\r\nHere is where the decorator pattern comes in - you can create *decorators* like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface OrderAddition {}\r\nclass WithChicken implements OrderAddition {}\r\nclass WithMushrooms implements OrderAddition {}\r\nclass WithPork implements OrderAddition {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich can then be used with any food. The `interface Extras` is here for convenience. It helps keep the dependency hierarchy focused and more practical - `HasPrice` is a bit too vague - anything can have a price, but with `OrderAddition` we know exactly what kind this is. Another way to call it is `OrderDecorator` - it&#39;s a bit drier but it&#39;s more descriptive and immediately calls out the design pattern used.\r\n\r\n##Using classes\r\n\r\nSo, here is what your code can look like with decorators:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MainDish { //renaming it to be more descriptive\r\n    getPrice(): number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Ramen implements MainDish {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n        return 5;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass Spaghetti implements MainDish {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n        return 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n//decorators would need to do the same as the object they decorate, \r\n//so the decorator implements the MainDish interface\r\ninterface OrderAddition extends MainDish {} \r\n\r\nabstract class AbstractOrderAddition implements OrderAddition {\r\n  protected base: MainDish;\r\n\r\n  constructor(base: MainDish) {\r\n    this.base = base;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  abstract getPrice(): number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass WithChicken extends AbstractOrderAddition {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n      return this.base.getPrice() + 5\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass WithMushrooms extends AbstractOrderAddition {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n      return this.base.getPrice() + 1\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass WithPork extends AbstractOrderAddition {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n      return this.base.getPrice() + 3\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich then allows you to do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet order: MainDish = new Ramen();\r\norder = new WithPork(order);\r\norder = new WithMushrooms(order);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Check on the TypeScript Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=1&amp;ssc=1&amp;pln=59&amp;pc=52#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgLJ1AEWAZwBbIDeyA9CVBCHALagDmywYyYA9sgEYrWsXIAmEHAijAADmGAA3CAChkC5HQhgACqKQAKAJQAuZCACu1LlADcsgL6zZCADZwcOZACUalRtTF2I1SmGd0LFwCQnlFZTUNCB0icMVFCjBDKBBkAFYLBOtre0dnAGUxODo8FUlPb19-QIwQbHw4hMj1YC1tJoTElRS0gEYABizFHJsyQQReODYoZwB3VkM7fgMICBW2AXYwMuQcd2RHFl3WDgArCARmHYgATwFLqcgAGmRZMhxt3Ymn3kqfPzgZw3NB1BoEUCQWCIOSQ6DwJDIADyUEEUAAgvx+ExgKw0hAAB6QED8WrBRqESxvWRwDg4MBQRDMPJOZDoukMpkotGY7GSPH-apA5Go6C8nECsIKMRQViQK7rTiOCD6IL1EIWcKTED0qCGK68TQcZWqsEhDpSxQ7XAAOmNOBQAF4lQ6zKQSABrNZiY4oXjAOigOB2N4KazhWm6plKFStdr6IwmaAWcMs5wAdSYeAAwng2l78UTKKS2RzGVduWKsRK0paFC1orE691kqljrb7RAbQ22jEOgBqDLxZCjWwOVmZnaoQz4WWsajOQnEkvsqMV0UY6v82vDnvtToJJK9ds4O3K7uxxsD5B9YejtPISd4VS8D3IJfF5yrznrnlb3E7s0l69k2w4KEebbWqenYXlEIHXgAzHeVg2D4zAwMAsxgJWUCmuSBDOiAEBzK47ggDoFgYVhOHIIRxGPlmL5QB6mhUfSOHaJRmHsRutGrCRT7TrOrDzjgrHcdhG6cTY2qfD4Np2KwdCaAARGxkloiprzqThsFxn20myGheyPCSOF4eqjR0SRRQlGUYCSBRsgOtq-A0dZDE7Lm+aUJoLl4m5UkWP5Zm8R5T5MSxIWBWi0nRe5-GeXgQl4HOC5+aZMXQIZsmsPJinKSp8UblpJmubpe4GWYQA)\r\n\r\n##Using decorator functions\r\n\r\nThis, however, is highly formal usage of decorators. In JavaScript, you can short-circuit some of this and still maintain the same idea. Instead of having *classes* you can have your decorators as functions that modify the instance they are given:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface OrderAdditionMaker{\r\n  (additionalPrice: number) : AddToOrder\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface AddToOrder {\r\n  (base: MainDish) : MainDish\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst withChicken: AddToOrder = function withChicken(base: MainDish): MainDish {\r\n  //take a reference of the original\r\n  const originalGetPrice: MainDish[&quot;getPrice&quot;] = base.getPrice.bind(base);\r\n\r\n  //overwrite the `getPrice` method\r\n  base.getPrice = function(): ReturnType&lt;MainDish[&quot;getPrice&quot;]&gt; {\r\n    return originalGetPrice() + 5;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return base;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be further generalised into a more functional route by using [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) so you can easily derive all the decorator functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//interface for making decorators\r\ninterface OrderAdditionMaker{\r\n  (additionalPrice: number) : AddToOrder\r\n}\r\n\r\n//decorator function\r\ninterface AddToOrder {\r\n  (base: MainDish) : MainDish\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst withExtra: OrderAdditionMaker = function (additionalPrice: number) {\r\n  return function (base: MainDish): MainDish {\r\n    const originalGetPrice: MainDish[&quot;getPrice&quot;] = base.getPrice.bind(base);\r\n    base.getPrice = function (): ReturnType&lt;MainDish[&quot;getPrice&quot;]&gt; {\r\n      return originalGetPrice() + additionalPrice;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return base;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst withChicken: AddToOrder = withExtra(5);\r\nconst withMushrooms: AddToOrder = withExtra(1);\r\nconst withPork: AddToOrder = withExtra(3);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Check on the TypeScript Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=1&amp;ssc=1&amp;pln=52&amp;pc=52#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgLJ1AEWAZwBbIDeyA9CVBCHALagDmywYyYA9sgEYrWsXIAmEHAijAADmGAA3CAChkC5HQhgACqKQAKAJQAuZCACu1LlADcsgL6zZCADZwcOZACUalRtTF2I1SmGd0LFwCQnlFZTUNCB0icMVFCjBDKBBkAFYLBOtre0dnAGUxODo8FUlPb19-QIwQbHw4hMj1YC1tJoTElRS0gEYABizFHJsyUEhYRBQYXmRqOABregEIBF44NigcWQnoeCRkAHkoQSgAQX5+JmBWEHRF6DCFTTgrm7u4O1akfSMTaAdfSXfgAFVYJzOVjGJEE6ygmzmMEMIAQkjuu3A+2myBB4Mh0E6mg4jgg+iC9RCQLQdQaeGhtjuOGYAHcmHgAKIADzACP0BIu73R9yWhIAvMhkajhchXkLblRvtE-sZTB1nsgkr1JSi0QrZSScGSacF8HoTZTGhqFOsQMzkLxgHRQF8AOIqH7Gil0gDaACIWtE-QBdZASw0QAB0gbaUY4oH4xNJ2mGCgj0Y90TDOul+p0+hcPVSoIAnmIIAAeb0hf0xpAhgB8nQSWtSDtEzsV7qisdiAGpkG9rsKvp7U8hrPFNUW0hHhqNGXbWeyAMJ4NqPEDAq7407i5BssCcnkIzTpFOL+2HvCoQz4KCsVjUHDbsEQvdQbPX7m8uCaPoXraV7sqovCLK+u5nF+7I-qeADMF6yD4zAwMA2xgAK5K0iE2YgBALKuO4IA6BYqHoQK0FHqBUCLJoZHMgKF70RhH6UTed54A+T44HRaEMR+iFAawPiRnYrB0JofrMQKfoADSSnxLFnBmPbtIhyHIEatr8JhFp0rh+HIEUJRlGAkgkbIWl3DprEStea4bpQmhWSANlnBeLlufu17UbRnmMRY-m2Qe7K3vej7Ps5azWQFNhCSJYkSX6QVnHJmnRa5AoqZ6OgpkAA)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377215/best-practice-of-javascript-class-method-definition-to-calc-food-price-with-topp/58379467#58379467","title":"best practice of javascript class method definition to calc food price with toppings"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11755546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2bb1dacdc39da736af41c83bb0705acc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"antoni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11755546/antoni"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58379467,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571065483,"creation_date":1571057336,"question_id":58377215,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377215","body_markdown":"I have started a restaurant and created software the determine the price of all the items on the menu\r\nI started by creating a class for each menu item so that the price can be calculated using an interface.\r\n```javascript\r\ninterface HasPrice {\r\n    getPrice(): number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Ramen implements HasPrice {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n        return 5;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass Spaghetti implements HasPrice {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n        return 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShe then decided there should be topping so she used the decorator pattern.\r\n```javascript\r\nclass RamenWithPork extends Ramen {\r\n    getPrice() {\r\n         super.getPrice() + 3;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked until I decided to expand the topping menu and it became too cumbersome to deal combinatorial amount of classes.

(So it&#39;s not just a simple `useState` hidden behind the custom hooks, just keep that in mind)\r\n\r\nBasically the `reset()` functions looks like this:\r\n\r\nI also implemented a function to clear all filters which is calling the `reset()` function for each filter:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst clearFilters = () =&gt; {\r\n    const filterValues = Object.values(filters);\r\n    for (const filter of filterValues) {\r\n      filter.reset();\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n```\r\nThe `reset()` function is triggering a state update (which is of course async) in each filter to reset all the selected filters. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// setSelected is the setter comming from the return value of a useState statement\r\nconst reset = () =&gt; setSelected(initialSelected);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Right after the resetting** I want to do stuff with the reseted/updated values and **NOT with the values before the state update**, e.g. calling API with reseted filters:\r\n```js\r\nclearFilters();\r\ncallAPI();\r\n```\r\nIn this case the API is called with the old values (before the update in the `reset()`)\r\nSo how can i wait for all filters to finish there state updated? Is my code just badly structured? Am  i overseeing something?\r\n\r\nFor single state updates I could simply use `useEffect` but this would be really cumbersome when waiting for multiple state updates..\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t take

was looking through some github projects on AI.\r\nI saw an interesting implementation, that i wanted to try.\r\n\r\nBasically, it allows the implemented algorithms to be used by different games, using generic interfaces.\r\nHere is the general idea :\r\n\r\n    public static class TreeSearch&lt;TGame, TMove, TPlayer&gt;\r\n        where TGame : TreeSearch&lt;TGame, TMove, TPlayer&gt;.IGame\r\n    {\r\n        public interface IGame :\r\n            ICurrentPlayer&lt;TPlayer&gt;,\r\n            IDoMove&lt;TMove&gt;,\r\n            IGameOver,\r\n            ILegalMoves&lt;TMove&gt;,\r\n            IUndoMove,\r\n            IScore&lt;TPlayer&gt;\r\n        { }\r\n\r\n        public static TMove GetBestMove(TGame game)\r\n        {\r\n            // Implementation\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the class implement its own interface `IGame`, congregation of many other interface representing the &quot;base interaction&quot; of a game.\r\nAs i understand it, this is useful to specify what are **exactly** the requirements for the game, as the algorithms each have different needs, and thus different interface requirements.\r\n\r\nI decided to implement it, and did it like so :\r\n\r\n    public class GameLogic :\r\n            ICurrentPlayer&lt;Player&gt;,\r\n            IDoMove&lt;Move&gt;,\r\n            IGameOver,\r\n            ILegalMoves&lt;Move&gt;,\r\n            IUndoMove,\r\n            IScore&lt;Player&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        // Implementation of ICurrentPlayer, IDoMove, ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI use each interfaces directly, as i want my game to be able to use many AI algorithms.\r\n\r\nHowever, i&#39;m quite stuck at how i&#39;m supposed to use it :\r\n\r\n    Move move = TreeSearch&lt;GameLogic, Move, Player&gt;.GetBestMove(instanceOfGameLogic);\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t work like this, because `GameLogic` isn&#39;t directly using `TreeSearch.IGame`. \r\nI could replace the list of interfaces in `Gamelogic` with `TreeSearch.IGame`, but i don&#39;t want to have a strong reference to each AI algorithms (like `TreeSearch`) that i will use. Also, i find that it decrease the readability.\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to use the algorithms, without having to implement `IGame` in `GameLogic`?**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377199/how-to-use-a-public-nested-interface-used-in-its-own-class","title":"How to use a public-nested interface, used in its own

developing a mobile game where two players play against each other. The game determines who goes first with simple random number generation.\r\n\r\nThe 50/50 chance 100% of the time may not be a good idea. Some context:\r\n\r\n1) The advantage the player going first has is significant. “Quick Play” matches are finished rather quickly. This advantage is/can be increased further due to having items the other player doesn’t (a huge focus on solid, fair matchmaking will help solve this).\r\n\r\n2) The game includes a “Competitive Mode” which includes a skill ranking system, although much simpler compared to highly complex, popular AAA titles. Although this has a different GameMode (therefore slightly different rules) and longer match times, coin toss winners still have a slight advantage (matchmaking will be geared towards rank and less on items players have, so item collection will have significant impact on the player who wins the coin toss).\r\n\r\nWith that being said, to my question: if a player is unlucky and getting 3+ games in a row losing the coin toss, I’d like to *very slightly* increase their odds, nothing dramatic, with these odds increasing even more if they get a 4th and 5th loss in the coin-toss, until they finally get to go first.\r\n\r\nWhat would be best solution this?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377195/random-determining-of-who-goes-first-increase-likelihood","closed_reason":"primarily opinion-based","title":"Random determining of who goes first - increase likelihood?"},{"tags":["virtual-machine","virtualbox","kali-linux"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12214437,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBSIedpLn5IGlM-OAo-Cy4JZVOaHPAydqPGfIAuMA=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Cype","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12214437/cype"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571057261,"creation_date":1571057261,"question_id":58377193,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377193","body_markdown":"When starting my Kali Virtual Machine (running Kali linux 32 bit), I enter the boot menu (listing installs and live boot modes) and select graphical install.

Many of the tidyverse functions are written that way but in general a formula is not by default a function.\r\n\r\n## fn$\r\n\r\nThe gusbfn package does have `fn$` which will allow just about any function which accepts a function argument to accept formulas.  Preface the function call with `fn$` and then formula arguments are interpreted as functions (subject to certain rules).  \r\n\r\nIn terms of the example in the question we can do this which does not require writing a special version of `sapply` to interpret formulas as functions:\r\n\r\n    library(gsubfn)\r\n\r\n    fn$sapply(names(mtcars), item ~ mean(mtcars[[item]]))\r\n\r\ngiving:\r\n\r\n           mpg        cyl       disp         hp       drat         wt       qsec \r\n     20.090625   6.187500 230.721875 146.687500   3.596563   3.217250  17.848750 \r\n            vs         am       gear       carb \r\n      0.437500   0.406250   3.687500   2.812500 \r\n\r\nSee `?fn` for more information and examples.\r\n\r\n## match.funfn\r\n\r\nThe gsubfn package also has `match.funfn` which is like `match.fun` in base R except it will also interpret formulas as functions.  This lets one write their own functions that accept formula arguments interpreting them as functions. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the example in the question:\r\n\r\n    library(gsubfn)\r\n\r\n    sapplyfn &lt;- function(X, FUN, ...) {\r\n      FUN &lt;- match.funfn(FUN)\r\n      sapply(X, FUN, ...)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    sapplyfn(names(mtcars), item ~ mean(mtcars[[item]]))\r\n    \r\ngiving:\r\n    \r\n           mpg        cyl       disp         hp       drat         wt       qsec \r\n     20.090625   6.187500 230.721875 146.687500   3.596563   3.217250  17.848750 \r\n            vs         am       gear       carb \r\n      0.437500   0.406250   3.687500   2.812500 \r\n\r\n## as.function.formula\r\n\r\nThe gsubfn package also has `as.function.formula` which will convert a formula to a function.

For example,\r\n\r\n    library(gsubfn)\r\n    as.function(item ~ mean(mtcars[[item]]))\r\n\r\ngiving:\r\n\r\n    function (item) \r\n    mean(mtcars[[item]])\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377184/with-which-generality-can-tilde-operator-be-used-to-build-anonymous-functions/58377667#58377667","title":"With which generality can tilde operator be used to build anonymous functions?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3064,"user_id":10191355,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cpZ5O_lDsAo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAuw/2pPS2BuC7bM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"gersht","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10191355/gersht"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571059308,"creation_date":1571059308,"answer_id":58377742,"question_id":58377184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58377742","body_markdown":"As caldwellst says above, the tilda `~` is used to create a formula object, which is a bit of unevaluated code that can be used later.

concatenated.\r\n\r\nTo prevent that, force order of operation, so addition of your numbers is first, for example (already shown in other answers): `&quot;the result is &quot; + (num01 + num02)`\r\n\r\nNow it will first sum two numbers, then concatenate with given

On NVIDIA, it seems to be irritatingly wrong. So I was curious, and extended the kernel, to also print the `get_local_size`:\r\n\r\n    void kernel test()\r\n    {\r\n        printf(&quot;G0:%d   G1:%d   G2:%d   L0:%d   L1:%d   L2:%d  S0:%d  S1:%d  S2:%d\\n&quot;, \r\n            get_global_id(0),\r\n            get_global_id(1),\r\n            get_global_id(2),\r\n            get_local_id(0),\r\n            get_local_id(1),\r\n            get_local_id(2),\r\n            get_local_size(0),\r\n            get_local_size(1),\r\n            get_local_size(2));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, the `get_local_id` certainly **must** be smaller than the size, otherwise most kernels would just crash.

The problem seems to be that putting everything into a single `printf` messes up some internal buffer.\r\n\r\nThis is a pity, of course. It basically makes it impossible to use `printf` for the only purpose that it could sensibly be used for inside a kernel, namely for *debugging*...\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn aside: The specifications remain a bit hard to interpret at that point - at least when it comes to deciding whether the observed behavior is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. From the [Khronos documentation of `printf`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/printfFunction.html) :\r\n\r\n&gt; In the case that printf is executed from multiple work-items concurrently, there is no guarantee of ordering with respect to written data. For example, it is valid for the output of a work-item with a global id (0,0,1) to appear intermixed with the output of a work-item with a global id (0,0,4) and so on. \r\n\r\nThe [NVIDIA documentation of the CUDA `printf` implementation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#limitations) also contains some disclaimers and talks about some buffers that may be overwritten, but mapping this (on the technical level of a specification) to the OpenCL behavior is difficult...\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377163/opencl-ndrange-dimensions-order-bug-on-nvidia/58378259#58378259","title":"OpenCL NDRange dimensions order bug on nVidia?"}],"owner":{"reputation":641,"user_id":623415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e88085394bf8eeaddeb13104d65ccf6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BoeroBoy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/623415/boeroboy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58378259,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571061090,"creation_date":1571057187,"question_id":58377163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58377163","body_markdown":"I know OpenCL is fairly idle these days - especially NVidia&#39;s CUDA implementation.

But if I schedule the exact same kernel with same dimensions using NVidia I the following output:\r\n\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:0   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:1   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:2   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:0   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:1   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:0   L2:0\r\n    G0:3   G1:0   G2:2   L0:0   L1:1   L2:0\r\n\r\nIt seems like NVidia&#39;s interpretation of global/local dimensions is interleaved which doesn&#39;t match spec.  This doesn&#39;t seem to involve the C++ bindings either.  Local ID should never be anything but zero and get_global_id(1) is always zero.\r\n\r\nI know NVidia doesn&#39;t care much for OpenCL but this seems like a fairly major issue.  Anyone else encounter something like this?  This isn&#39;t a synch issue with printf. I&#39;ve noticed it in actual data use cases and built this kernel only to demonstrate it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377163/opencl-ndrange-dimensions-order-bug-on-nvidia","title":"OpenCL NDRange dimensions order bug on nVidia?"},{"tags":["angular","angular-pipe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7479,"user_id":554340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbsAe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"magnattic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/554340/magnattic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571057794,"post_id":58377161,"comment_id":103103287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58377161/angular-pipe-that-transforms-number-to-readable-fraction#comment103103287_58377161"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9324,"user_id":3680098,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuWp6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Evaldas Buinauskas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3680098/evaldas-buinauskas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571058045,"creation_date":1571058045,"answer_id":58377429,"question_id":58377161,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58377429","body_markdown":"I think you could use [fractionjs](https://github.com/ekg/fraction.js) to get it working.
