In your case this is the `Future&lt;SharedPreferences&gt;` returned from `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`. \r\n\r\nThen then `FutureBuilder` expects a `builder`. The builder will be called with the context and an `AsyncSnapshot` corresponding to the type of your future. The `AsyncSnapshot` is the representation of the most recent interaction with an asynchronous computation - in your case the retrieval of the shared preferences instance. The `AsyncSnapshot.connectionState` allows us to decide what widget to render based on the state of the `Future`. The [`FutureBuilder` example][1] goes into detail about the different states, for now we will just look at `ConnectionState.done`.\r\n\r\nIn the `done` state the snapshot contains either an error - which we&#39;re not going to deal with here - or `data`, the return value of your asynchronous function call.\r\n\r\nTaking your example we can create a `FutureBuilder&lt;SharedPreferences&gt;`. The generic type indicates the type that the future will return. We assign the future from the shared preferences `getInstance` method to the future parameter and a builder closure that expects the context and the async snapshot.\r\n\r\nWith this your code could look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    class _PathMakerState extends State&lt;PathMaker&gt; {\r\n      _PathMakerState();\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      void initState() {\r\n        super.initState();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      void dispose() {\r\n        super.dispose();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void setTiles(SharedPreferences prefs) {\r\n        // Get timing variables\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; keys = prefs.getKeys();\r\n        if(keys.contains(&#39;numTiles&#39;)) {\r\n          widget.numTiles = prefs.getDouble(&#39;numTiles&#39;);\r\n        }else {\r\n          widget.numTiles = 15.5;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n        return new MaterialApp(\r\n          title: &#39;Path Maker&#39;,\r\n          theme: new ThemeData(\r\n            primarySwatch: Colors.green,\r\n          ),\r\n          home: FutureBuilder&lt;SharedPreferences&gt;(\r\n            future: SharedPreferences.getInstance(),\r\n            builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;SharedPreferences&gt; snapshot) {\r\n              switch (snapshot.connectionState) {\r\n                case ConnectionState.done:\r\n                  // get the tile number from the shared preference instance\r\n                  // stored in snapshot.data\r\n                  setTiles(snapshot.data);\r\n                  return Path(widget.numTiles);\r\n                default:\r\n                  return Text(&quot;Loading...&quot;);\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          ),\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275746/flutter-how-do-i-make-a-widget-draw-only-after-shared-preferences-have-been-re/58276516#58276516","title":"Flutter - how do I make a widget draw only after shared preferences have been read?"}],"owner":{"reputation":955,"user_id":583271,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d1b1fdd6d52e31f3aedafa6a51e0829d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sharon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/583271/sharon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58276516,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570479148,"creation_date":1570475444,"question_id":58275746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275746","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get to grips with Flutter by creating an app which draws a random path (it will get more advanced before it&#39;s finished!).  The user can change the number of tiles in the path, and this value gets saved in Shared Preferences. If they don&#39;t change the number of tiles, it&#39;s set to its default value of 15.5.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that it&#39;s trying to draw the path before it&#39;s finished reading the Shared Preferences, and crashing out because the number of tiles isn&#39;t set.  I could set the default value, but then it would draw that first, and then redraw with a different number of tiles, which I don&#39;t want - I want it to draw the user-set number of tiles first, and only use the default value if the user hasn&#39;t set the number.\r\n\r\nI think I need to use a `FutureBuilder`, but I can&#39;t find a lot online that I can get my head around.  Here&#39;s what I have so far (this is main.dart):\r\n\r\n\r\n    void main() {\r\n      runApp(MaterialApp(\r\n        title: &quot;Path Maker&quot;,\r\n        home: PathMaker(),\r\n      ));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class PathMaker extends StatefulWidget {\r\n    \r\n      int numTiles;\r\n    \r\n      PathMaker({\r\n            Key key,\r\n            this.numTiles\r\n        }): super(key: key);\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      _PathMakerState createState() =&gt; new _PathMakerState();\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class _PathMakerState extends State&lt;PathMaker&gt; {\r\n    \r\n      _PathMakerState();\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      void initState() {\r\n        super.initState();\r\n    \r\n        getPreferences();\r\n    \r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      void dispose() {\r\n        super.dispose();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void getPreferences() async {\r\n          SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();\r\n          // Get timing variables\r\n          Set&lt;String&gt; keys = prefs.getKeys();\r\n          if(keys.contains(&#39;numTiles&#39;)) {\r\n            numTiles = prefs.getInt(&#39;numTiles&#39;);\r\n          }else {\r\n            numTiles = 15.5;\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @override\r\n      Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n        return new MaterialApp(\r\n          title: &#39;Path Maker&#39;,\r\n          theme: new ThemeData(\r\n            primarySwatch: Colors.green,\r\n          ),\r\n          home: new Path(widget.numTiles),\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n(path.dart is another file which defines the `Path` class - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant, but can post it if needed). So, basically, I want it to call build only after `getPreferences` has completed. How do I handle this?

struct sockaddr address;\r\n            int addr_len;\r\n    } connection_t;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    int main(int argc, char ** argv)\r\n    {\r\n            int             sock = -1;\r\n            struct          sockaddr_in address;\r\n            int             port = 12345;\r\n            connection_t*   connection;\r\n            pthread_t       thread;\r\n            int             cnt = 0;\r\n    \r\n            signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint);\r\n    \r\n            // Create the listening socket\r\n            sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);\r\n            if (sock &lt;= 0){\r\n                    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: error: cannot create socket\\n&quot;, argv[0]);\r\n                    return -3;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            // Bind socket to port\r\n            address.sin_family = AF_INET;\r\n            address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\r\n            address.sin_port = htons(port);\r\n            if (bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;address, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)) &lt; 0){\r\n                    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: error: cannot bind socket to port %d\\n&quot;, argv[0], port);\r\n                    return -4;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            // Listen on the port\r\n            if (listen(sock, 5) &lt; 0){\r\n                    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: error: cannot listen on port\\n&quot;, argv[0]);\r\n                    return -5;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            printf( &quot;...starting loop...\\n&quot; );\r\n            while (1){\r\n                    // Accept incoming connections\r\n                    connection = (connection_t *)malloc(sizeof(connection_t));\r\n                    connection-&gt;addr_len = 20;\r\n                    connection-&gt;sock = accept(sock, &amp;connection-&gt;address, &amp;connection-&gt;addr_len);\r\n    \r\n                    if (connection-&gt;sock &lt;= 0){\r\n                            printf(&quot;Connection FAILED :: Value of errno: %d\\n &quot;, errno);\r\n                            free(connection);\r\n                    }\r\n                    else{\r\n                            // Start a new thread but do not wait for it\r\n                            pthread_create(&amp;thread, 0, process, (void *)connection);\r\n                            pthread_detach(thread);\r\n                    }\r\n            }\r\n            return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe above should be C Network Programming 101.  And it does work great… until I start sending large number of client requests.  When I do, I see this:\r\n\r\n    me@mylinux:/home/me/myServer\r\n    ...starting loop...\r\n     Connection FAILED :: Value of errno: 24\r\n     Connection FAILED :: Value of errno: 24\r\n     Connection FAILED :: Value of errno: 24\r\n     Connection FAILED :: Value of errno: 24\r\n\r\nHmm.  After working like a champ for a bunch of earlier connections, `accept()` is suddenly choking.\r\n\r\nA quick Google search reveals that ***Errno 24*** is ***EMFILE: “Too many open files.”***  And a search of other StackOverflow posts ([here][1]) suggests that each time my code calls `accept()`, this creates a file descriptor for the new open connection.  This means each new thread lays claim to a new file descriptor.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing that the problem is that the threads do not clean up after themselves.  They read from the socket, do their work, then terminate without informing the system that their FD is no longer needed.  Thus, the system maintains all those FDs and I get an avalanche of Errno 24s after the first 4,096 connections.\r\n\r\n(I&#39;ve run “`ulimit -n 4096`” on my Linux box.)\r\n\r\nSo here’s the `process()` function that guides each thread; I’ve omitted the string-parsing part because its out-of-scope here.  Note that after the thread does its work, it ***tries*** to clean up after itself:\r\n\r\n    void * process(void * ptr)\r\n    {\r\n            char * buffer;\r\n            int len;\r\n            connection_t * conn;          // See above for this data type\r\n            long addr = 0;\r\n    \r\n            conn = (connection_t *)ptr;\r\n    \r\n            // read length of message\r\n            read(conn-&gt;sock, &amp;len, sizeof(int));\r\n            if (len &gt; 0)\r\n            {\r\n                    addr = (long)((struct sockaddr_in *)&amp;conn-&gt;address)-&gt;sin_addr.s_addr;\r\n                    buffer = (char *)malloc((len+1)*sizeof(char));\r\n                    buffer[len] = 0;\r\n    \r\n                    // Read the message from the socket\r\n                    read(conn-&gt;sock, buffer, len);\r\n    \r\n                    // Parse client message\r\n                    parseCliMsg( buffer, len );\r\n    \r\n                    free(buffer);\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            // Close socket and clean up\r\n            close(conn-&gt;sock);\r\n            free(conn);\r\n            pthread_exit(0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDoes anyone see where I’m going wrong?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/880557/socket-accept-too-many-open-files","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275736/errno-24-too-many-open-files-are-my-threads-not-closing-their-sockets","title":"Errno 24: Too many open files.

are different status codes used by the solver, as you can see here in the official documentation: https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/routing_options.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct statuses for FAIL: ROUTING_FAIL_TIMEOUT and ROUTING_FAIL so it seems plausible that the solver has a proof of infeasibility. However, the solver relies on heuristics both to find initial solutions and to improve existing solutions while relying on constraint programming techniques such as propagation to check whether assignments are feasible.\r\n\r\nProving infeasibility is very difficult for a complex VRP problem since you need to identify some subset of mutually infeasible constraints and be able to deduce that no solution can satisfy them all at the same time. This is an NP-complete problem even for 3-SAT and while you can often do this in practice for SAT problems, it becomes very hard when the domains of the variables are large. I therefore doubt that there is a proof in your sense when the solver fails, but rather a &quot;heuristic&quot; FAIL.\r\n\r\nRegarding details it is possible to log the search via the SearchLog or InitGoogleLogging.

Now I want to create a TkInter gui to be able to e.g. change the parameters on the fly. I imagine it beeing like a remote control.\r\nBut I am struggeling to get a responsive interface. The training of one epoch will take a couple of minutes without me beeing able to intercept.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen a lot of examples wich use the .after() method to maybe update a clock on the gui, which is fine, because updating doesn&#39;t take minutes.

is that the values returned by python ord () DO match the VB equivalent AscW(), but altering all that code is going to be more problematic than moving forward with the rest of what we&#39;ve done in Python so far.\r\n\r\nShould I be altering the locale&#39;s preferredencoding or the sys&#39;s default encoding to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275697/decoding-python-3-7-4-filenames-that-were-created-with-vb","title":"Decoding Python 3.7.4 Filenames That Were Created With VB"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":10430394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/617c4a391a2d6429bcad808d3fe18e72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10430394/j-doe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570476965,"post_id":58275694,"comment_id":102918732,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275694/inconsistent-alignment-of-title-and-suptitle-in-matplotlib#comment102918732_58275694"},{"owner":{"reputation":655,"user_id":3394386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f36befa47364f055cb5980fc4e14b7a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jody Klymak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3394386/jody-klymak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570485392,"post_id":58275694,"comment_id":102921600,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275694/inconsistent-alignment-of-title-and-suptitle-in-matplotlib#comment102921600_58275694"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6766,"user_id":5309300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d02949d5e7330b5db7c59283041d86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asongtoruin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5309300/asongtoruin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570478628,"post_id":58276153,"comment_id":102919362,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275694/inconsistent-alignment-of-title-and-suptitle-in-matplotlib/58276153#comment102919362_58276153"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":10430394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/617c4a391a2d6429bcad808d3fe18e72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10430394/j-doe"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570477299,"creation_date":1570477299,"answer_id":58276153,"question_id":58275694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58276153","body_markdown":"I know this isn&#39;t the perfect answer and basically a repost of my comment, but here goes nothing:\r\n```python\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\r\n\r\ncats = (&#39;hour&#39;, &#39;Two&#39;)\r\nvals = (12, 4) \r\nax.barh(cats, vals, align=&#39;center&#39;)\r\nplt.figtext(.5,.95,&#39;Foo Bar&#39;, fontsize=18, ha=&#39;center&#39;)\r\nplt.figtext(.5,.9,&#39;lol bottom text&#39;,fontsize=10,ha=&#39;center&#39;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nYou need to manually adjust the .95 and .9 values depending on the font sizes though.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275694/inconsistent-alignment-of-title-and-suptitle-in-matplotlib/58276153#58276153","title":"Inconsistent alignment of title and suptitle in matplotlib"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6766,"user_id":5309300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d02949d5e7330b5db7c59283041d86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asongtoruin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5309300/asongtoruin"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570478578,"post_id":58276199,"comment_id":102919342,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275694/inconsistent-alignment-of-title-and-suptitle-in-matplotlib/58276199#comment102919342_58276199"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":281,"user_id":12161501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f1dbca07a89828dc840c717079ccb01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"soyapencil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161501/soyapencil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6766,"user_id":5309300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d02949d5e7330b5db7c59283041d86?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asongtoruin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5309300/asongtoruin"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570478504,"last_edit_date":1570478504,"creation_date":1570477505,"answer_id":58276199,"question_id":58275694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58276199","body_markdown":"matplotlib aligns suptitle to the *figure*, and title to the *subplot*.

Use local storage so you don&#39;t have to refetch your token if user refreshes the page (since it&#39;ll be lost from memory). Also you&#39;ll have same benefit when working with multiple tabs. You can easily create some `LocalStorageService` that does all parsing/stringify for you so you don&#39;t have to worry.\r\n 2. I&#39;d suggest to move that logic to some kind of service where you&#39;ll control your token flow much easier - e.g. what happens if user logs out or somehow token becomes invalid? You&#39;d have to get new token from other place than your App (since root `componentDidMount` will be called only once) and also you&#39;d need to clear the current interval (on which you won&#39;t have reference with current implementation) to avoid multiple intervals.\r\n\r\nInstead of intervals maybe you could even use `setTimeout` to avoid having multiple intervals in edge cases:\r\n\r\n    getToken() {\r\n        // do your logic\r\n        clearTimeout(this.tokenExpire);\r\n        this.tokenExpire = setTimeout(() =&gt; getToken(), 5000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOverall your implementation is fine - it can only be improved for easier maintenance and you&#39;ll need to cover some edge cases (at least ones mentioned above).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275675/best-way-to-refresh-token-every-hour/58276681#58276681","title":"Best way to refresh token every hour?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11634863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/749a9589384ba27f285c35393be5c573?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LotusFlower","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11634863/lotusflower"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58276681,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570479999,"creation_date":1570475125,"question_id":58275675,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275675","body_markdown":"I am building a website with React and I have to send about 3 requests per every page, but first of all I have to get communication token that needs to be refreshed every hour by the way, and then use it as a base for all other requests. \r\n\r\nI have a plan to get it as soon as App mounts and put it in state (redux, thunk) and use it in every component that subscribes to store and then put setInterval function in componentDidMount method too.

way you can achieve this effect is by defining the `width`, `height` and `padding` of the `&lt;body&gt;` and then using `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements:\r\n\r\n - one pseudo-element to `clip-path` out the rest of the visible viewport\r\n - one pseudo-element to `clip-path` a **fixed border** for the text-window\r\n\r\nIn the example below, the `::before` pseudo-element `clip-path` paints the whole of the rest of the body background black and the `::after` pseudo-element `clip-path` gives the text-window a `6px` red border.\r\n\r\nEverything (except the width of the border) is defined using CSS Custom Properties at the top, so you can alter any of:\r\n\r\n - `--textWidth`\r\n - `--textHeight`\r\n - `--textPadding`\r\n\r\nand everything else will reconfigure

lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &#39;and what is the use of a book,&#39; thought Alice &#39;without pictures or conversation?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &#39;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!&#39; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &#39;ORANGE MARMALADE&#39;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&#39;Well!&#39; thought Alice to herself, &#39;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#39;ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&#39;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&#39; (Which was very likely true.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! &#39;I wonder how many miles I&#39;ve fallen by this time?&#39; she said aloud. &#39;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—&#39; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) &#39;—yes, that&#39;s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&#39;ve got to?&#39; (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Presently she began again. &#39;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it&#39;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—&#39; (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn&#39;t sound at all the right word) &#39;—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&#39;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&#39; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you&#39;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &#39;And what an ignorant little girl she&#39;ll think me for asking! No, it&#39;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &#39;Dinah&#39;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&#39; (Dinah was the cat.) &#39;I hope they&#39;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I&#39;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&#39;s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&#39; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &#39;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&#39; and sometimes, &#39;Do bats eat cats?&#39; for, you see, as she couldn&#39;t answer either question, it didn&#39;t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &#39;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&#39; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &#39;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#39;s getting!&#39; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&#39;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; &#39;and even if my head would go through,&#39; thought poor Alice, &#39;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.&#39; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (&#39;which certainly was not here before,&#39; said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &#39;DRINK ME&#39; beautifully printed on it in large letters.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It was all very well to say &#39;Drink me,&#39; but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. &#39;No, I&#39;ll look first,&#39; she said, &#39;and see whether it&#39;s marked &quot;poison&quot; or not&#39;; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &#39;poison,&#39; it

beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &#39;and what is the use of a book,&#39; thought Alice &#39;without pictures or conversation?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &#39;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!&#39; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &#39;ORANGE MARMALADE&#39;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;&#39;Well!&#39; thought Alice to herself, &#39;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#39;ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&#39;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&#39; (Which was very likely true.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! &#39;I wonder how many miles I&#39;ve fallen by this time?&#39; she said aloud. &#39;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—&#39; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) &#39;—yes, that&#39;s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&#39;ve got to?&#39; (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Presently she began again. &#39;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it&#39;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—&#39; (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn&#39;t sound at all the right word) &#39;—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&#39;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&#39; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you&#39;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &#39;And what an ignorant little girl she&#39;ll think me for asking! No, it&#39;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &#39;Dinah&#39;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&#39; (Dinah was the cat.) &#39;I hope they&#39;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I&#39;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&#39;s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&#39; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &#39;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&#39; and sometimes, &#39;Do bats eat cats?&#39; for, you see, as she couldn&#39;t answer either question, it didn&#39;t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &#39;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&#39; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &#39;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#39;s getting!&#39; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&#39;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; &#39;and even if my head would go through,&#39; thought poor Alice, &#39;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.&#39; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (&#39;which certainly was not here before,&#39; said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &#39;DRINK ME&#39; beautifully printed on it in large letters.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;It was all very well to say &#39;Drink me,&#39; but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. &#39;No, I&#39;ll look first,&#39; she said, &#39;and see whether it&#39;s marked &quot;poison&quot; or not&#39;; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &#39;poison,&#39; it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;However, this bottle was not marked &#39;poison,&#39; so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275664/for-an-interior-div-with-a-border-how-do-i-scroll-the-divs-contents-but-keep/58383903#58383903","title":"For an interior DIV with a border, how do I scroll the DIV&#39;s contents, but keep border fixed?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":12115161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYQBY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Love","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115161/john-love"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571328531,"creation_date":1571328531,"answer_id":58436770,"question_id":58275664,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58436770","body_markdown":"I would recommend that you adopt a file = &quot;rootDependencies.css&quot;, or whatever you choose to name it, and link to it in your .html file.

So I&#39;m trying to use ttypescript to get around that restriction.  \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried the following...\r\n\r\nNote: test.ts contains the following \r\n```\r\nimport { keys } from &#39;ts-transformer-keys&#39;;\r\n\r\ndescribe(&quot;xyz&quot;), () =&gt; {\r\n  it(&quot;123&quot;, (done) =&gt; {\r\n     keys&lt;CustomInterface&gt;();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttempt 1) - Set the ts-node with an environment variable\r\n\r\n`TS_NODE_COMPILER=&quot;ttypescript&quot; mocha test/test.ts --require ts-node/register`\r\n\r\nThen I have the following in test/tsconfig.json\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;plugins&quot;: [\r\n      { &quot;transform&quot;: &quot;ts-transformer-keys/transformer&quot; }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis results in `Uncaught TypeError: ts_transformer_keys_1.keys is not a function` which indicates that the custom transformer wasn&#39;t used at compile time.\r\n\r\nAttempt 2) Following the typescript API example from ts-transformer-keys\r\n\r\nI added a mocha.opts file with the following\r\n```\r\n--file test/transformer-config.js\r\n```\r\nand a transformer-config.js file with the following\r\n```\r\nconst ts = require(&#39;typescript&#39;);\r\nconst keysTransformer = require(&#39;ts-transformer-keys/transformer&#39;).default;\r\n\r\nconst program = ts.createProgram([&#39;test/test.ts&#39;], {\r\n  strict: true,\r\n  noEmitOnError: true,\r\n  target: ts.ScriptTarget.ES5\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst transformers = {\r\n  before: [keysTransformer(program)],\r\n  after: []\r\n};\r\nconst { emitSkipped, diagnostics } = program.emit(undefined, undefined, undefined, false, transformers);\r\n\r\nif (emitSkipped) {\r\n  throw new Error(diagnostics.map(diagnostic =&gt; diagnostic.messageText).join(&#39;\\n&#39;));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen I invoke it like this `mocha test/test.ts --require ts-node/register`\r\n\r\nThis results in the following error\r\n```\r\n\r\n/Users/jjohnson/Documents/OCS/hmp/git/hmp-server/server/test/ttypescript-register.js:17\r\n  throw new Error(diagnostics.map(diagnostic =&gt; diagnostic.messageText).join(&#39;\\n&#39;));\r\n        ^\r\nError: [object Object]\r\n[object Object]\r\n[object Object]\r\n    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/jjohnson/Documents/OCS/hmp/git/hmp-server/server/test/ttypescript-register.js:17:9)\r\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:777:30)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt feels like in Attempt 1 it wasn&#39;t ever calling the code that sets the custom transformer in tsconfig.json or if it was getting called the code was failing silently.\r\n\r\nIt feels like in Attempt 2 I&#39;m creating a new instance of the typescript program and then that fails for some reason.

so this is my first ever question. I&#39;m bracing for feeling dumb, but here goes.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m currently learning Ruby before I become familiar with Ruby on Rails. I&#39;ve been following an online course, and at this juncture we&#39;ve just learned how to use rack to handle some of the logic for a server, and running a config.ru file to start the server.\r\n\r\nBut, every time I try to start the server using rackup, I get a ```LoadError``` like this:\r\n\r\n```Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n\t1: from /usr/local/bin/rackup:23:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;\r\n/usr/local/bin/rackup:23:in `load&#39;: cannot load such file -- /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/rack-2.0.7/bin/rackup (LoadError)```\r\n\r\n```\r\nNow, I&#39;ve been slamming my head against every possible angle I can think of. I understand this error to be saying that path - from which the rackup command is trying to load the rack code - doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;ve tried making multiple different .ru files to test if its a problem with the shebang, a problem with the content of the .ru file, and so on. But that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. I can&#39;t even run the example lobster.ru file that comes with the rack gem. I get the same error. \r\n\r\nI also tried reinstalling the rack gem, changing the default version of it. Neither helped. I considered using different versions of Ruby, but that didn&#39;t seem like it was relevant. The problem is clearly that rackup is looking in the wrong place. \r\n\r\nBut, if I use `require &#39;rack&#39;` on a simple ruby server, there aren&#39;t any problems. Rack works. So all of this told me that it must be something to do with the rackup command itself.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when I go to ```/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems``` there is no ```rack-2.0.7``` directory. Instead, that directory is in ```var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve noticed that `var/lib/gems/2.5.0` is in the GEM PATHS of the RubyGems Environment. But `/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0&#39;` is not.\r\n\r\nSo my ideas on solving the issue were:\r\n\r\n1. Change the way that rackup loads the rack gem. I looked into this and it would mean changing what looks like seriously proper code in the rubygems or even rackup files. I will break it if I tamper with it because I have no clue what I&#39;m doing. This is not a sensible option.  \r\n\r\n2. Add the `usr/lib...` to the GEM PATH, so that when rackup and rubygems looks for the rack gem it can find it. Having searched a bit about this possibility, it seems like manually adding things to the GEM PATH is not recommended. I tried it anyway...but it didn&#39;t work (FYI, I added to the GEM PATH by adding `export GEM_PATH=...` to the `.bashrc`\r\n\r\nEDIT: Having slept on it, I can see why the second option above doesn&#39;t work either. Simply adding the missing directory to the GEM PATH or to the $LOAD_PATH won&#39;t help because rackup is looking in a specific place for rack but can&#39;t find it. If I look at the rackup code, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif Gem.respond_to?(:activate_bin_path)\r\nload Gem.activate_bin_path(&#39;rack&#39;, &#39;rackup&#39;, version)\r\nelse\r\ngem &quot;rack&quot;, version\r\nload Gem.bin_path(&quot;rack&quot;, &quot;rackup&quot;, version)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe segments of code doing the looking are directed by `:activate_bin_path` and `bin_path`, which are both defined in the `rubygems` code. \r\n\r\nSo if I understand this correctly, its like rackup is getting the wrong directions to a place that doesn&#39;t exist. Like it&#39;s turning right when it should go left. My options are either to somehow change its directions to tell it &#39;go left&#39; or to build the thing its looking for &#39;on the right&#39;.\r\n\r\nMaking sure it &#39;goes left&#39; is the better solution but I can&#39;t figure out how to do that. So I built what its looking for &#39;on the right&#39;: I copied the rack gem to the `/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/` directory that rackup is looking in. It has solved the problem of rackup not finding  what it is looking for - rackup now works and the server works. BUT this solution is going to haunt me in the future, e.g. if rack is updated... It&#39;s a barbarian solution, and I&#39;d prefer an elegant one. \r\n\r\nSo if anyone has insight into how to make sure rackup gets the proper directions, please let me know! I think it must have something to do with making sure the rubygems `bin_path` and `:activate_bin_path` correspond with where the gems are actually installed. At the moment the fundamental discrepancy seems to be that the gems live in `var` but its looking in `usr`. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!

are two ways to approach your issue:\r\n\r\n 1. Although it is understandable that you tried defining a `hosts: localhost` to run some tasks on the controller, you don&#39;t really need this. Using [`delegate_to: localhost`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation) and [`run_once: true`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#run-once) on the steps you want to run on your controller is a far better approach.\r\n 2. If you really want to go this way (using `hosts: localhost`), for some reason, then you&#39;ll need to save the return of your `find`, with [`set_fact`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/set_fact_module.html?highlight=set_fact) in order to reuse it in other hosts with the help of the global [`hostvars`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html?highlight=hostvars#accessing-information-about-other-hosts-with-magic-variables)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUsing delegation\r\n---\r\n\r\nAny task in the play can be delegated to another host. This is quite simple to do and would just use one extra `delegate_to` options on your task:\r\n\r\n    - name: Delegate a find to localhost\r\n      find: \r\n        path: /test\r\n        file_type: any\r\n      register: localhost_find\r\n      delegate_to: localhost\r\n      run_once: true\r\n\r\nWhen doing so, I would advice you to also use `run_once: true`, because, if you delegate the task to another host, there is no need to, let&#39;s say run it ten times if you have ten hosts in your host group.\r\n\r\nHere is a little example about that\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    - hosts: hosts\r\n      become: true\r\n      gather_facts: false\r\n    \r\n      tasks:\r\n        - name: Delegate directory creation to localhost\r\n          file: \r\n            path: /test\r\n            state: directory\r\n          delegate_to: localhost\r\n          run_once: true\r\n    \r\n        - name: Create directory on hosts\r\n          file:\r\n            path: /test                 \r\n            state: directory\r\n    \r\n        - name: Delegate file creation to localhost\r\n          file:\r\n            path: /test/localhost.txt                 \r\n            state: touch\r\n          delegate_to: localhost\r\n          run_once: true\r\n    \r\n        - name: Create file on hosts\r\n          file:\r\n            path: /test/host.txt\r\n            state: touch\r\n    \r\n        - name: Delegate a find to localhost\r\n          find: \r\n            path: /test\r\n            file_type: any\r\n          register: localhost_find\r\n          delegate_to: localhost\r\n          run_once: true\r\n     \r\n        - name: Find in the hosts for comparison\r\n          find:\r\n            path: /test\r\n            file_type: any\r\n          register: host_find\r\n    \r\n        - name: List /test of localhost\r\n          debug:\r\n            msg: &quot;{{ localhost_find.files | map(attribute=&#39;path&#39;) | list }}&quot;\r\n    \r\n        - name: List /test of host\r\n          debug:    \r\n            msg: &quot;{{ host_find.files | map(attribute=&#39;path&#39;) | list }}&quot;

If it&#39;s not in the store it will dispatch two actions, `MessageLoaded` and `VisitorRequested`. If it&#39;s in the store, we will just dispatch one action, `MessageLoaded`. So logic would be in that order:\r\n\r\n1. `MessageRequested` was dispatched with an `id` as the input\r\n2. Now we call the api with `id` as the parameter, we have a `Message` object returned. Message definition below. It has a `visitor_id` property: ` mergeMap((action) =&gt; this.converseService.getMessage( action[0].message_id ))`\r\n3. Now we query the store, whether the `visitor_id` in the `Message` object exists in the Visitor state (`this.store.pipe(select(selectVisitorById( m.visitor_id ) )`)\r\n4. Now we have an if condition we need to apply, \r\n    \r\n  a. if `select` returned something, then the visitor is already in the store, and we will return just the `MessageLoaded` action.\r\n  \r\n  b. If `select` didnt return a `visitor`, we now have to dispatch an additional action `VisitorRequested` to request the visitor. We still need to dispatch the `MessageLoaded` action. So thats 2 actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    loadMessage$ = this.actions$\r\n        .pipe(\r\n            ofType&lt;MessageRequested&gt;(MessageActionTypes.MessageRequested),\r\n            mergeMap((action) =&gt; this.converseService.getMessage( action[0].message_id )),\r\n            map(m =&gt; m.model),\r\n            withLatestFrom(  this.store.pipe(select(selectVisitorById( m.visitor_id ) ))),\r\n            tap( ([message,visitor]) =&gt; {\r\n                if (visitor == null) new VisitorRequested(message.visitor_id);\r\n            }),\r\n            map( ([message, visitor]) =&gt; {\r\n                return new MessageLoaded({message});\r\n            } )\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class Message {\r\n    id: number;\r\n    message: string;\r\n    visitor_id: number;\r\n    is_from_visitor: boolean;\r\n    created_at: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class MessageResponse extends Response {\r\n  model: Message\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class Response{\r\n  message:String;\r\n  didError: boolean;\r\n  errorMessage: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode looks alright, except that `withLatestFrom` does not accept inputs, so I can&#39;t pass the `m.visitor_id` variable, and now I have to think of another approach. I tried using `forkJoin` and `concatMap`, but didnt make it.\r\n\r\nWhat would be right operators to utilize in the scenario?\r\n\r\nUpdate #1\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is what finally worked with the help of all the answers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Effect()\r\n    loadMessage$ = this.actions$\r\n        .pipe(\r\n            ofType&lt;MessageRequested&gt;(MessageActionTypes.MessageRequested),\r\n            mergeMap((action) =&gt; this.converseService.getMessage( action.message_id )),\r\n            map(m =&gt; m.model),\r\n            concatMap(message =&gt;\r\n                of(message).pipe(\r\n                  withLatestFrom(this.store.pipe(select(selectVisitorById(message.visitor_id))))\r\n                )\r\n            ),            \r\n            tap( ([message,visitor]) =&gt; {\r\n                if (!(visitor)) this.store.dispatch(new VisitorRequested(message.visitor_id));\r\n            }),\r\n            map( ([message, visitor]) =&gt; {\r\n

Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n[![Right-aligned example][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNote that the labels on the left are right-aligned. It seems simple, but I haven&#39;t found a way to do it in SwiftUI in a way that can handle dynamic changes (localized labels, dynamic text, etc).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried having each row as an HStack and using a custom alignment on the labels:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct RightAligned: View {\r\n    @State var name = &quot;&quot;\r\n    @State var email = &quot;&quot;\r\n    @State var phone = &quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack(alignment: .labelAlign) {\r\n            Row(name: &quot;Name&quot;, value: $name)\r\n            Row(name: &quot;Email&quot;, value: $email)\r\n            Row(name: &quot;Phone&quot;, value: $phone)\r\n        }\r\n        .border(Color.green)\r\n        .padding(30)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct Row: View {\r\n    let name: String\r\n    @Binding var value: String\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        HStack {\r\n            Text(&quot;\\(name):&quot;)\r\n                .alignmentGuide(.labelAlign, computeValue: { $0[.trailing] })\r\n            TextField(name, text: $value)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension HorizontalAlignment {\r\n    private enum LabelAlign: AlignmentID {\r\n        static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -&gt; CGFloat {\r\n            context[.trailing]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    static let labelAlign = HorizontalAlignment(LabelAlign.self)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will align the labels, but it just shifts the HStacks so they expand outside the containing VStack:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso tried using preferences to pass the widths of the labels up to the parent so I can make all the label frames the same size:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct PrefsAlignment: View {\r\n    @State var labelWidth: CGFloat = 100\r\n    @State var name = &quot;&quot;\r\n    @State var email = &quot;&quot;\r\n    @State var phone = &quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack(alignment: .leading) {\r\n            PrefsRow(name: &quot;Name&quot;, labelWidth: $labelWidth, value: $name)\r\n            PrefsRow(name: &quot;Email&quot;, labelWidth: $labelWidth, value: $email)\r\n            PrefsRow(name: &quot;Phone&quot;, labelWidth: $labelWidth, value: $phone)\r\n        }\r\n        .onPreferenceChange(LabelPreferenceKey.self) { width in\r\n            self.labelWidth = width\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct PrefsRow: View {\r\n    let name: String\r\n    @Binding var labelWidth: CGFloat\r\n    @Binding var value: String\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        HStack {\r\n            HStack {\r\n                Spacer()\r\n                Text(&quot;\\(name):&quot;)\r\n                    .background(PreferenceSetterView())\r\n            }\r\n            .frame(width: labelWidth)\r\n            TextField(name, text: $value)\r\n                .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct PreferenceSetterView: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        GeometryReader { proxy in\r\n            Rectangle()\r\n                .fill(Color.clear)\r\n                .preference(key: LabelPreferenceKey.self, value: proxy.size.width)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nstruct LabelPreferenceKey: PreferenceKey {\r\n    static var defaultValue: CGFloat = 0\r\n    \r\n    static func reduce(value: inout CGFloat, nextValue: () -&gt; CGFloat) {\r\n        value = max(value, nextValue())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis puts the views in a feedback loop where the preferences drive a change to the frames of the label HStacks which recursively changes the preferences and around we go until the width is driven to 0.\r\n\r\nYou could manually set the frames of the labels to the widest one, but this is fragile and wouldn&#39;t work if they change due to things like localization or dynamic type.\r\n\r\nHow in the world do you do this simple layout?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/y3nKR.png\r\n  [2]:

key problem here is this comment:\r\n\r\n    // tvalue of next entry\r\n\r\nIn C# dictionaries are not ordered, so there is no &quot;next entry&quot;.  (A `SortedDictionary` sorts on key, not value, so that&#39;s no help to you.  An `OrderedDictionary` might be what you want, but let&#39;s assume that you have a `Dictionary` in hand and solve the problem from that point.)\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s transform your unsorted `name -&gt; offset` data structure into a better data structure. \r\n\r\nSuppose we start with this:\r\n\r\n        // name -&gt; offset\r\n        var dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;() { \r\n          { &quot;foo&quot;, 100 }, { &quot;bar&quot;, 40 }, { &quot;blah&quot;, 200 } };\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll sort the dictionary by value and put the offsets into this sorted list:\r\n\r\n        // index -&gt; offset\r\n        var list = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n\r\nAnd then we&#39;ll make a new dictionary that maps names to indexes into this list:\r\n\r\n        // name -&gt; index\r\n        var newDict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s build the list and new dictionary from the old one:\r\n\r\n        foreach (var pair in dict.OrderBy(pair =&gt; pair.Value))\r\n        {\r\n            newDict[pair.Key] = list.Count;\r\n            list.Add(pair.Value);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nWe also need the offset of the last byte as the last thing in the list:\r\n\r\n        list.Add(theOffsetOfTheLastByte);\r\n\r\nAnd now we can do a two-step lookup to get the offset and the next offset. First we look up the index by name, and then the offset by index:\r\n\r\n        int fooIndex = newDict[&quot;foo&quot;]; // 1\r\n        int fooOffset = list[fooIndex]; // 100\r\n        int nextIndex = fooIndex + 1;\r\n        int nextOffset = list[nextIndex]; // 200\r\n\r\nMake

So in your case, that&#39;s were the &quot;complex&quot; coinflipping logic comes - complex, computing intense stuff should never happen on Swings so called `Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)` because this may freeze your GUI and doesn&#39;t feel smooth ;-)\r\n\r\n- next important part: call UI related operations ON the Event Dispatch Thread... this can be achieved by calling `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple and short in this example I created a subclass of `javax.swing.JLabel` and let it implement the `java.lang.Runnable` interface. In the `CoinFlipApp` class I got an `ExecutorService` instance - think of it as a threadpool. To get things executed in separate threads by this threadpool you have to pass it a `Runnable` which will then be scheduled for execution. This happens by calling `executorService.submit(coinFlip);`\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n\r\npublic class CoinFlipApp extends JFrame {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\r\n\t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tJFrame f = new JFrame();\r\n\t\t\tLayoutManager layoutManager = new BoxLayout(f.getContentPane(), BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS);\r\n\t\t\tf.getContentPane().setLayout(layoutManager);\r\n\t\t\tf.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n\t\t\tf.setVisible(true);\r\n\t\t\tfor (int i=0, j=5; i&lt;j; i++) {\r\n\t\t\t\tCoinFlip coinFlip = new CoinFlip();\r\n\t\t\t\tf.getContentPane().add(coinFlip);\r\n\t\t\t\texecutorService.submit(coinFlip);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n\r\npublic class CoinFlip extends JLabel implements Runnable {\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void run() {\r\n\t\tfinal String value = Boolean.toString(randomBoolean()).toUpperCase();\r\n\t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tCoinFlip.this.setText(value);\r\n\t\t\tCoinFlip.this.repaint();\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate boolean randomBoolean() {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n            // this can be removed later\r\n\t\t\tThread.sleep(2000);\r\n\t\t} catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn Math.random() &lt; 0.5;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275576/how-can-one-put-results-of-5-threads-into-label-text/58275997#58275997","title":"How can one put results of 5 threads into Label text?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12178508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB1daLixosL08Ki3BwQeSb1Ozw3WINl4q8Wyg4b=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Andrej Barna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12178508/andrej-barna"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58275997,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570477365,"creation_date":1570474639,"question_id":58275576,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58275576","body_markdown":"I have following code for making GridLayout.

How can I get this to balance out so I can use xPath (preferably by just using /LicensInfo/Signature?  Note that I can&#39;t drop the namespaces because I don&#39;t control the XML and if I don&#39;t make my document namespace aware then the xml signature doesn&#39;t work when the document is transferred back to the third party system. \r\n\r\n  Thanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58275547/namespace-in-xpath-java","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Namespace in XPath

up - most of my development experience is with the back end and, while I have plenty of programming experience in that context, I&#39;m not that familiar with Javascript.\r\n\r\nI have managed to produce a REST service that (via GSON) generates JSON populated with data from a database. This data includes a list of two values: a date and a double indicating a temperature for that date. An example of the generated JSON can be found [here][1].\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;d like to try and do is to take the data and display it in a line chart. I&#39;ve been trying this with Chartjs with extremely limited success.\r\n\r\nThe code I&#39;m currently using to try and get the chart working is:\r\n\r\n    var data = [{&quot;2019-03-30&quot;:11.0},{&quot;2019-03-31&quot;:10.2},{&quot;2019-04-01&quot;:10.0}];\r\n    var ctx = document.getElementById(&quot;temperatureChart&quot;).getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);\r\n    var chart = new Chart(ctx, {\r\n        type: &quot;line&quot;,\r\n        data: {\r\n            datasets: [\r\n                {\r\n                    label: &quot;2019&quot;,\r\n                    data: data,\r\n                    borderColor: &quot;rgb(192,49,62)&quot;,\r\n                    fill: false\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        options: {\r\n            responsive: true,\r\n            maintainAspectRatio: false,\r\n            title: {\r\n                display: true,\r\n                text: &#39;Temperature Averages&#39;\r\n            }\r\n           \r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAs you can see - I&#39;ve, for the moment, simply hard coded a few data values in an attempt to try and get it working. All this produces is a chart with nothing on the X Axis and the values -1.0 to 1.0 in .2 increments - screenshot at the bottom of this post.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I&#39;ve no idea how to proceed from here. Is Chartjs even a good choice for this? Starting to wonder if I&#39;ve bitten off more than I can chew.\r\n\r\n[![example chart][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pastebin.com/ua0XsgcG\r\n  [2]:
