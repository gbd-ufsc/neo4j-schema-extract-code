         43     -1.5\r\n-259  0.832       \r\n  522                   -32       \r\n                     -3.33       \r\n      12 -3 -45\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI want be able to get lists like this for each line\r\n\r\n[0, 8.42, 43, -1.5]\r\n\r\n[-259, 0.832]\r\n\r\n[522, -32]\r\n\r\n[-3.33]\r\n\r\n[12, -3, -45]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--Thanks in advance for any advice

want to make a class extend another class with a certain generic type where the types is being supplied by a decorator. I want to transfer the types from the decorator to be used in the abstract class MutatorBase. The reason I can&#39;t just skip the decorator and just extend the abstract class is because I need to get the constructor of the classes/types provided. \r\n\r\nThis is what im trying to achieve:\r\n```js\r\ntype Constructor&lt;T&gt; = new (...args: any[]) =&gt; T;\r\ntype ObjectTuple = readonly Constructor&lt;unknown&gt;[];\r\n\r\nfunction Mutator&lt;T extends ObjectTuple&gt;(...objs: T) {\r\n    return &lt;U extends MutatorBase&lt;T&gt;&gt;(mutator: U) =&gt; {\r\n      // do meta stuff\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract class MutatorBase&lt;T extends ObjectTuple = []&gt; {\r\n    mutate(fn: (objs: T) =&gt; void) {\r\n        // get objects\r\n        // call fn(objs);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ObjectExample {\r\n    data: number = 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Mutator(ObjectExample)\r\nclass MutatorExample extends MutatorBase {\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work, as the decorator can&#39;t find the function `mutate` even though the class extends `MutatorBase`. Also, the types provided in the decorator is probably not transferred aswell. \r\n\r\nNow `MutatorExample extends MutatorBase&lt;[typeof ObjectExample]&gt;` would fix the issue but requires me to supply the objects a second time which is something I want to avoid.\r\n\r\nIs this possible to do in any way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509158/make-a-class-extend-a-generic-class-with-certain-types-w-o-resupplying-them-usin","title":"Make a class extend a generic class with certain types w/o resupplying them using decorators"},{"tags":["spring","hibernate","spring-boot","jpa","spring-data-jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":527,"user_id":3211872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3edaef28f82c47f23183d0566e7824e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"earandap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211872/earandap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571764393,"post_id":58509156,"comment_id":103346352,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509156/jpa-find-by-with-multi-conditions#comment103346352_58509156"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":11294989,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NhLf8t6WfCw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcppqvJ-R-SgGMZhOUWF8bpNupEuA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"yong shi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11294989/yong-shi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":527,"user_id":3211872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3edaef28f82c47f23183d0566e7824e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"earandap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211872/earandap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571764839,"post_id":58509156,"comment_id":103346568,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509156/jpa-find-by-with-multi-conditions#comment103346568_58509156"},{"owner":{"reputation":527,"user_id":3211872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3edaef28f82c47f23183d0566e7824e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"earandap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211872/earandap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571765810,"post_id":58509156,"comment_id":103346986,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509156/jpa-find-by-with-multi-conditions#comment103346986_58509156"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":527,"user_id":3211872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3edaef28f82c47f23183d0566e7824e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"earandap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3211872/earandap"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571765585,"creation_date":1571765585,"answer_id":58509575,"question_id":58509156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509575","body_markdown":"I recommend you pass the date range as parameters to the method. \r\n\r\n     List&lt; Bulk_repository&gt; findByStatusIsAndCamp_typeIsAndCamp_start_dateBetween(int status, int campType, Date start, Date end)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509156/jpa-find-by-with-multi-conditions/58509575#58509575","title":"JPA find by with multi conditions"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":425,"user_id":9860374,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Matheus Cirillo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9860374/matheus-cirillo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571765687,"creation_date":1571765687,"answer_id":58509594,"question_id":58509156,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509594","body_markdown":"You can use `@Query` [from Spring Data JPA][1] with JPQL:\r\n\r\nJPQL doesn&#39;t support periods.

I have recently watched Andrew Sutton&#39;s talk on Concepts, and in the Q&amp;A session someone asked the following question (timestamp in the following link):\r\n[CppCon 2018: Andrew Sutton “Concepts in 60: Everything you need to know and nothing you don&#39;t”][1]\r\n\r\nSo the question boils down to: `If I have a concept that says A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C, another says C &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; A, would those be equivalent?` Andrew answered yes, but pointed out the fact the compiler has some internal methods (that is transparent to the user) to decompose the concepts into atomic logical propositions (`atomic constraints` as Andrew worded the term) and check whether they are equivalent.\r\n\r\nNow look at what cppreference says about `std::same_as`:\r\n\r\n&gt; `std::same_as&lt;T, U&gt;` subsumes `std::same_as&lt;U, T&gt;` and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIt is basically an &quot;if-and-only-if&quot; relationship: they imply each other. (Logical Equivalence)\r\n\r\nMy conjecture is that here the atomic constraints are `std::is_same_v&lt;T, U&gt;`. The way compilers treat `std::is_same_v` might make them think `std::is_same_v&lt;T, U&gt;` and `std::is_same_v&lt;U, T&gt;` as two different constraints (they are different entities!). So if you implement `std::same_as` using only one of them:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate&lt; class T, class U &gt;\r\nconcept same_as = detail::SameHelper&lt;T, U&gt;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `std::same_as&lt;T, U&gt;` and `std::same_as&lt;U, T&gt;` would &quot;explode&quot; to different atomic constrains and become not equivalent.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

None of this memory usage is due to the looping performed by `foldr`.  Rather it&#39;s all due to the use of boxed `Integers`.  If you switch to using plain `Ints` which the compiler can unbox:\r\n\r\n    main = print $ find (\\x -&gt; x `mod` 2 == 0) [1::Int, 3..1000000]\r\n                                                 ^^^^^\r\n\r\nthe memory performance changes drastically and demonstrates the true memory cost of `foldr`:\r\n\r\n          51,544 bytes allocated in the heap\r\n           3,480 bytes copied during GC\r\n          44,576 bytes maximum residency (1 sample(s))\r\n          25,056 bytes maximum slop\r\n               0 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)\r\n\r\nIf you test `findRec` with `Ints` like so:\r\n\r\n     main = print $ findRec (\\x -&gt; x `mod` 2 == 0) [1::Int, 3..1000000]\r\n\r\nyou&#39;ll see much worse memory performance:\r\n\r\n      40,051,528 bytes allocated in the heap\r\n          14,992 bytes copied during GC\r\n          44,576 bytes maximum residency (2 sample(s))\r\n          29,152 bytes maximum slop\r\n               0 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)\r\n\r\nwhich seems to make a compelling case that recursion should be avoided in preference to `foldr`, but this, too, is very misleading.  What you are seeing here is **not** the memory cost of recursion, but rather the memory cost of &quot;list building&quot;.\r\n\r\nSee, `foldr` and the expression `[1::Int, 3..1000000]` both include some magic called &quot;list fusion&quot;.  This means that when they are used together (i.e., when `foldr` is applied to `[1::Int 3..1000000]`), an optimization can be performed to completely eliminate the creation of a Haskell list.  Critically, the `foldr` code, even using list fusion, compiles to recursive code which looks like this:\r\n\r\n    main_go\r\n      = \\ x -&gt;\r\n          case gtInteger# x lim of {\r\n            __DEFAULT -&gt;\r\n              case eqInteger# (modInteger x lvl) lvl1 of {\r\n                __DEFAULT -&gt; main_go (plusInteger x lvl);\r\n                          -- ^^^^^^^ - SEE?  IT&#39;S JUST RECURSION\r\n                1# -&gt; Just x\r\n              };\r\n            1# -&gt; Nothing\r\n          }\r\n    end Rec }\r\n\r\nSo, it&#39;s list fusion, rather than &quot;avoiding recursion&quot; that makes  `find` faster than `findRec`.\r\n\r\nYou can see this is true by considering the performance of:\r\n\r\n    find1 :: Int -&gt; Maybe Int\r\n    find1 n | n &gt;= 1000000 = Nothing\r\n            | n `mod` 2 == 0 = Just n\r\n            | otherwise = find1 (n+2)\r\n    \r\n    main :: IO ()\r\n    main = print $ find1 1\r\n\r\nEven though this uses recursion, it doesn&#39;t generate a list (or use boxed `Integers`), so it runs just like the `foldr` version:\r\n\r\n          51,544 bytes allocated in the heap\r\n           3,480 bytes copied during GC\r\n          44,576 bytes maximum residency (1 sample(s))\r\n          25,056 bytes maximum slop\r\n               0 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)\r\n\r\nSo, what are the take home lessons?\r\n\r\n  * Always benchmark Haskell code using `ghc -O2`, never GHCi or `ghc` without optimization flags.\r\n  * Less than 10% of people in any Reddit thread know what they&#39;re talking about.\r\n  * `foldr` can sometimes perform better than explicit recursion when special optimizations like list fusion can apply.\r\n  * But in the general case, explicit recursion performs just as well as `foldr` or other specialized constructs.\r\n  * Also, optimizing Haskell code is hard.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509133/why-to-avoid-explicit-recursion-in-haskell/58513312#58513312","title":"Why to avoid Explicit recursion in Haskell?"}],"owner":{"reputation":161,"user_id":5817767,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/209584382725014/picture?type=large","display_name":"PK Chem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5817767/pk-chem"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":109,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58513312,"answer_count":2,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571785048,"creation_date":1571763689,"question_id":58509133,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509133","body_markdown":"I am new to Haskell.\r\n\r\nWhile studying about foldr many are suggesting to use it and avoid explicit recursion which can lead to Memory Inefficient code. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1nb80j/proper_use_of_recursion_in_haskell/\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I was running the sample mentioned in the above link.

*&quot;The line &quot;outcome.Add(text); &quot; shows an error as I am trying to send the wrong type to the list.&quot;*\r\n\r\nThe reason for this error is that you&#39;re trying to add a `string[]` to a list that contains `Club`. What we need is a method that will take a `string` and return a `Club`, and then we can call that method on each file line before adding to the list.\r\n\r\nA common way to do this is to add a `Parse` method to the `Club` class that can create an instance of the class from a string.\r\n\r\nA complete example could be provided if you shared some sample lines from the text file (typically these would map to properties of the class) and the definition of the `Club` class. However, here is a sample that you can hopefully apply to your specific situation.\r\n\r\nFirst, example lines in a text file:\r\n\r\n    1,Ravens,10/10/2019,2\r\n    2,Lions,05/25/2019,5.7\r\n    3,Tigers,09/12/2018,6.2\r\n    4,Bears,11/05/2019,9.1\r\n    5,Wildcats,03/04/2017,4.8\r\n\r\nAnd the definition of `Club`\r\n\r\n    public class Club\r\n    {\r\n        public int Id {get; set;}\r\n        public string Name {get; set;}\r\n        public DateTime FoundedOn {get; set;}\r\n        public double Score {get; set;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the lines in the text file map to properties of the `Club` class. Now we just need to add a `static` method to the `Club` class that returns an instance of the class based on a line of text from the file. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that we split the line on the comma character, convert each part to the correct data type for the property, set the properties, and return the class. We need to validate things like:\r\n\r\n - The line is not null\r\n - The line contains the correct number of parts\r\n - Each part is the correct datatype\r\n\r\nIn the case of a validation failure, we have some common choices:\r\n\r\n - Throw an exception\r\n - Return `null`\r\n - Return a partially populated class\r\n\r\nIn the sample below I&#39;m returning `null` to indicate bad data, mostly because it makes parsing the file easier.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the class with the `Parse` method added:\r\n\r\n    public class Club\r\n    {\r\n        public int Id { get; set; }\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n        public DateTime FoundedOn { get; set; }\r\n        public double Score { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public static Club Parse(string input)\r\n        {            \r\n            // Try to split the string on the comma and\r\n            // validate the result is not null and has 4 parts\r\n            var parts = input?.Split(&#39;,&#39;);\r\n            if (parts?.Length != 4) return null;\r\n\r\n            // Strongly typed variables to hold parsed values\r\n            int id;\r\n            string name = parts[1].Trim();\r\n            DateTime founded;\r\n            double score;\r\n\r\n            // Validate the parts of the string\r\n            if (!int.TryParse(parts[0], out id)) return null;\r\n            if (name.Length == 0) return null;\r\n            if (!DateTime.TryParse(parts[2], out founded)) return null;\r\n            if (!double.TryParse(parts[3], out score)) return null;\r\n\r\n            // Everything is ok, so return a Club instance with properties set\r\n            return new Club {Id = id, Name = name, FoundedOn = founded, Score = score};\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow that we have the parse method, we can create a `List&lt;Club&gt;` from the text file quite easily:\r\n\r\n    public static List&lt;Club&gt; ReadClubsTxtFile(string path)\r\n    {\r\n        return File.ReadAllLines(path).Select(Club.Parse).ToList();\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509128/is-there-a-way-to-read-a-txt-file-into-a-list-without-using-liststring/58509530#58509530","title":"Is there a way to read a txt file into a list without using List&lt;String&gt;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":5817354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1757079881178912/picture?type=large","display_name":"cat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5817354/cat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2063,"user_id":10573793,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GSS2TyEO1WA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBDBMW4iSv0gY77Gvs7NBxXO1BzcQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"preciousbetine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10573793/preciousbetine"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":96,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571769958,"creation_date":1571763669,"last_edit_date":1571769958,"question_id":58509128,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509128","body_markdown":"I am trying to read a .txt file into a list without using a `List&lt;string&gt;` type.

Web application also uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to do predictions.

In many settings these values are fixed, but lets ignore those, as you seem to have the flexibility. \r\n\r\nIn an experimental scan, what do you want? \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for high resolution you want the &quot;magnification&quot; DSD/DSO to be the highest, thus putting the detector far, and the object close to the source. This comes with problems though. A far detector requires higher scanning times  for the same SNR (due to scatter and other phenomena that will make your X-rays not go straight). And not only that, the bigger the mag, the more likely you are to have huge parts of the object completely outside your detector range, as detectors are not that big (in mm).\r\n\r\nSo the common scanning strategy to set these up is 1) put the detector as far as you can allow with your strict scanning time. 2) put the object as close to the source as you can, but always making sure its entire width fits in the detector. \r\n\r\nOften compromises can be done, particularly if you know what is the smallest object you want to see (allow 3 or 4 pixels to properly see it).\r\n\r\nHowever, algorithmic ally speaking? its irrelevant. I can&#39;t speak for ASTRA, but likely not even the computational time will be affected, as pixels that have zeroes are because they are out of the field of view and therefore simply not computed, at all. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow, for your simple toy example, if you completely ignore all physics, there is a way: \r\n\r\n1.- use simple trigonometry to compute what ratios of distances you need to make sure all the object is in the detector. \r\n\r\n2.- create a fully white image and go changing the sizes iteratively until the first couple of pixels in the outside part of the detector become zero.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509104/radon-transform-optimize-distance-between-source-detector-and-center-of-rotatio/58526354#58526354","title":"Radon Transform: optimize distance between source/detector and center of rotation"}],"owner":{"reputation":112,"user_id":8263951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0cbd9655d0fba6ae08421f4b98143685?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pazu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8263951/pazu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571844562,"creation_date":1571763574,"question_id":58509104,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509104","body_markdown":"My question is whether I can optimally determine the distance between the source and the center of rotation and the distance between the center of rotation and the detector array for a given image and projection geometry. \r\nBy optimal I mean that the number of zero entries of the measurement vector is minimized.\r\n\r\nIn the following code snippet I used the Astra toolbox with which we simulate our 2D tomography.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom skimage.io import imread\r\nfrom astra import creators, optomo\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n# load some 400x400 pixel image \r\nimage = imread(&quot;/path/to/image.png, as_gray=True)&quot;\r\n\r\n# create geometries and projector\r\n# proj_geom = astra_create_proj_geom(&#39;fanflat&#39;, det_width, det_count, angles, source_origin, origin_det)\r\nproj_geom = creators.create_proj_geom(&#39;fanflat&#39;, 1.0, 400, np.linspace(0,np.pi,180), 1500.0, 500.0);\r\nvol_geom = creators.create_vol_geom(400,400)\r\nproj_id = creators.create_projector(&#39;line_fanflat&#39;, proj_geom, vol_geom)\r\n\r\n# create forward projection\r\n# fp is our measurement vector\r\nW = optomo.OpTomo(proj_id)\r\nfp = W*image\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my example if I use ```np.linspace(0,np.pi,180)``` the number of zero-entries of ```fp``` are ```1108```, if I use ```np.linspace(0,np.pi/180,180)``` instead the number increases to ```5133``` which makes me believe that the values ```1500.0``` and ```500.0``` are not well chosen.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509104/radon-transform-optimize-distance-between-source-detector-and-center-of-rotatio","title":"Radon Transform: optimize distance between source/detector and center of rotation"},{"tags":["composer-php"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":359,"user_id":3419535,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65fc0329501359ea67262fd819afaf03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FantomX1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3419535/fantomx1"},"last_editor":{"reputation":359,"user_id":3419535,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65fc0329501359ea67262fd819afaf03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FantomX1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3419535/fantomx1"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571770694,"last_edit_date":1571770694,"creation_date":1571763568,"answer_id":58509103,"question_id":58509102,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509103","body_markdown":"It&#39;s somehow a standard behavior due to composer documentation --no-cache &quot;Disables the use of the cache directory.

I am looking through the configuration (which is applied by ansible) to find possible causes for this problem, but for the moment without any success.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m creating this user using this set of commands:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event UserShell /bin/bash\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event RealName event\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event UniqueID 1111\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event PrimaryGroupID ${GROUP_ID}\r\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/event NFSHomeDirectory /Users/event\r\nsudo dscl . -passwd /Users/event ${PASSWORD}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to log in, the login screen acts as if the password was wrong, however I now for sure that it is not. From a terminal opened from a network user&#39;s session, I can log in as the user `event` (using `login event` and typing the password that I set).\r\n\r\nA detail that can be useful (and actually the one that makes me think that something is blocked/disabled in the configuration), when I type the good password, the login screen reacts directly. But when I type the wrong password, the login screen waits a moment before reacting.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I can&#39;t bring more details to the problem, I can&#39;t share anything from the configuration or the ansible-playbook.

We have switched over to just resolving our domain to the DNS name of an `ALB` and have `TLS` termination happening at the `ALB`. It then routes the traffic to the cluster over `http/8080`. Ever since this switch, the tasks are continuously failing the health check. When the health check was set to `8080/tcp` with an `NLB`, it worked fine. With the `ALB`, the health check is `8080/http`, and now it fails. The security group attached to the cluster allows traffic from the `ALB` over 8080. Additionally, I can hit the DNS name of the load balancer and get an expected response. So, I know they are actually up and running and working fine.

What is passed is an _expression_ defining an **anonymous function**. Such expressions, when using the `=&gt;` operator, are commonly called **lambda expressions**. `x` is the part of the expression which determines how the function is called. It&#39;s a placeholder for the input variable used by the function expression.\r\n\r\nIt will help you understand if I give you a pretend version of how the `FirstOrDefault()` method might be implemented:\r\n\r\n    public T FirstOrDefault&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items, Func&lt;T, boolean&gt; predicate)\r\n    {\r\n        foreach(T item in items)\r\n        {\r\n            if(predicate(item)) return item;\r\n        }\r\n        return default(T);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things to understand in that code:\r\n\r\n`this` in front of the first parameter turns the function into an extension method. Instead of calling the method with two arguments, you skip the first argument... call it with only the second argument as if it were a member of the type from the first argument. ie, `_db.Posts.FirstOrDefault(foo)` instead of `FirstOrDefault(_db.Posts, foo)`. \r\n\r\nThe `key` variable in the expression is called a **closure**. It is available as part of the `predicate()` function inside this method, even though it&#39;s not passed as an argument. This is why the `predicate(item)` call is able to determine `true` or `false` with only `item` as an input.\r\n\r\nThe `predicate()` function call within this method was passed as an argument to the method. That is how the `x =&gt; x.Key == key` argument is interpreted; it becomes the `predicate()` method used by the `FirstOrDefault()` function. You can think of it as if `predicate()` were defined like this:\r\n\r\n    bool predicate(T x)\r\n    {\r\n        return x.Key == key;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe C# compiler makes this translation for you automatically, and even infers the correct run-time type for `T` and automatically handles scope for the `key` closure.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509051/im-confused-about-this-statement-lambda-operator/58509333#58509333","title":"I&#39;m confused about this statement.

FROM posts WHERE Key = @key`, the result of which is mapped into a `Post` entity.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of language features at play to make all this work, so let&#39;s have a look!\r\n\r\n## Extension methods ##\r\nExtension methods are static methods, but can be called like instance methods.\r\nThey are defined in static classes and have a &#39;receiver&#39; argument. In the case of `FirstOrDefault` the extension method looks like this:\r\n```\r\npublic static class Queryable {\r\n    public static T FirstOrDefault&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; source, Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; predicate = null) {\r\n        // do something with source and predicate and return something as a result\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s usage `_db.Posts.FirstOrDefault(...)` is actually syntactic sugar and will be translated by the C# compiler to a static method call a la `Queryable.FirstOrDefault(_db.Posts, ...)`.\r\n\r\nNote that extension methods are, despite the syntactic sugar, still static methods do not have have access to their receiver&#39;s internal state. They can only access public members.\r\n\r\n## Delegates ##\r\nC# has support for pseudo-first-class functions, called delegates. There are several ways to instantiate a delegate.\r\nThey can be used to `capture` existing methods or they can be initialized with an anonymous function.\r\n\r\nThe most elegant way to initialize a delegate with an anonymous function is to use lambda style functions like `x =&gt; x + 10` or `(x, y) =&gt; x + y`.\r\nThe reason you don&#39;t see type annotations in these examples is that the compiler can infer the types of the arguments in many common situations.\r\n\r\nHere is another example:\r\n```\r\n// This is a normal function\r\nbool IsEven(int x) {\r\n  return x % 2 == 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This is an anonymous function captured in a delegate of type `Func&lt;T1, TResult&gt;`\r\nFunc&lt;int, bool&gt; isEven = x =&gt; x % 2 == 0;\r\n\r\n// You can also capture methods in delegates\r\nFunc&lt;int, bool&gt; isEven = IsEven;\r\n\r\n// Methods can be called\r\nint a = IsEven(5); // result is false\r\n\r\n// Delegates can be called as well\r\nint b = isEven(4); // result is true\r\n\r\n// The power of delegates comes from being able to pass them around as arguments\r\nList&lt;int&gt; Filter(IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; array, Func&lt;int, bool&gt; predicate) {\r\n  var result = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n  foreach (var n in array) {\r\n    if (predicate(n)) {\r\n      result.Add(n);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar numbers = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };\r\nvar evenNumbers = Filter(numbers, isEven); // result is a list of { 2, 4, 6 }\r\nvar numbersGt4 = Filter(numbers, x =&gt; x &gt; 4); // result is a list of { 5, 6 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expression trees ##\r\nThe C# compiler has a feature that allows you to create an Expression tree with normal-looking code.\r\n\r\nFor example `Expression&lt;Func&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; add10Expr = (x =&gt; x + 10);` will initialize `add10Expr` not with an actual function but with an expression tree, which is an object graph.\r\n\r\nInitialized by hand it would look like this:\r\n```\r\nExpression xParameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(int), &quot;x&quot;);\r\nExpression&lt;Func&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; add10Expr = \r\n    Expression.Lambda&lt;Func&lt;int, int&gt;&gt;(\r\n        Expression.Add(\r\n            xParameter, \r\n            Expression.Constant(10)\r\n        ),\r\n        xParameter\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n(which is super cumbersome)\r\n\r\nThe power of expression trees comes from being able to create, inspect and transform them at runtime.\r\n\r\nWhich is what Entity Framework does: it translates these C# expression trees to SQL code.\r\n\r\n## Entity Framework ##\r\nWith all of these features together you can write predicates and other code in C# which gets translated by Entity Framework to SQL, the results of which are &quot;materialized&quot; as normal C# objects.\r\n\r\nYou can write complex queries to the database all within the comfort of C#.\r\nAnd best of all, your code is statically typed.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.queryable.firstordefault?view=netframework-4.8\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods\r\n  [4]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression?view=netframework-4.8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509051/im-confused-about-this-statement-lambda-operator/58511301#58511301","title":"I&#39;m confused about this statement.

Each document is about 300 pages long, and has some sections that have titles in bold letters. My goal is to do a text search in these files, and when I find the given phrase, extract the whole section that contains this phrase. My idea was to parse the html text so that it becomes a list of paragraphs, find the location of the phrase, and then extract everything from the bold letters (title of this section) just prior to bold letters just after (title of the next section). \r\n\r\nI tried in a number of different ways, but none of them does what I want. the following was promising:\r\n\r\n      myhtmlfile = &quot;I:/myfolder/myfile.html&quot;\r\n      myhtmltxt2 = htmlTreeParse(myhtmlfile, useInternal = TRUE)\r\n\r\nBut while I can display the object &quot;myhtmltxt2&quot; and it looks like html with tags (which is what I need so that I can look for `&quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot;` ), it is an external pointer.

If the list is empty, you know didn&#39;t find anything:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    indices = []\r\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\r\n        if x==arr[i]:\r\n            indices.append(i)\r\n\r\n    if indices:\r\n        for index in indices:\r\n            print(&#39;Found at:&#39;, index)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;Not found&quot;)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThat last option can be achieved more concisely with a single list comprehension and the [`enumerate()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate):\r\n\r\n    indices = [i for i, value in enumerate(arr) if value == x]\r\n    if indices:\r\n        for index in indices:\r\n            print(&quot;Found at&quot;, index)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;Not found&quot;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58509038/how-to-stop-executing-else-block-while-searching-in-an-array-in-python/58509214#58509214","title":"How to stop executing else block while searching in an array in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":10776930,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/139455033263907/picture?type=large","display_name":"Epsilon zero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10776930/epsilon-zero"},"last_editor":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571764048,"creation_date":1571763320,"last_edit_date":1571763994,"question_id":58509038,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58509038","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s the code part :-\r\n\r\n    arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6]\r\n\r\nand say I want to search 5 and print it&#39;s index.\r\n\r\n    x=Number to be searched \r\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\r\n        if x==arr[i]:\r\n            print(&quot;Found at&quot;,i)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;Not found&quot;)\r\n\r\nThe output is as follows :-\r\n \r\n    Found at 4\r\n    Found at 10\r\n    Not found\r\n\r\nHoe to get rid of the last line ?

The idea to to model each tree as a blob then use contour filtering with a minimum threshold area to ignore the noise. To determine automatic threshold levels, you can use [Otsu&#39;s threshold](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_thresholding/py_thresholding.html#otsus-binarization) by appending `cv2.THRESH_OTSU` or [Adaptive threshold](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_thresholding/py_thresholding.html#adaptive-thresholding) with `cv2.adaptiveThreshold()`. This approach has problems when the trees are very close together since they form a single blob. Possible improvements could be to find the average area of each tree then find the floor with a large blob.

Does anyone know how to get this away? \r\n\r\nThanks is advance! \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RL4EL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508980/matplotlib-shows-old-yticks-when-yticks-have-changes-with-plt-yticks","title":"matplotlib shows old yticks when yticks have changes with plt.yticks()"},{"tags":["security","encryption","ssl-certificate","azure-cosmosdb"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7102,"user_id":39624,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9785f9da9aa7595121aba6aafdb8ea91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlexDrenea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/39624/alexdrenea"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571768450,"creation_date":1571768450,"answer_id":58510233,"question_id":58508978,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58510233","body_markdown":"I think that&#39;s a great starting point.\r\n\r\nJust one note, your data is only as secure as the access keys to the account so, on top encryption at rest and in transit, the Access Key is probably the most sensitive piece of information you need to protect.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to use a KeyVault to store the database access key rather than define them as environment variables.

Databases are so fast now, that I wouldn&#39;t ever worry about that.\r\n\r\nSo the benefit to normalization is data integrity.  If you have your data in normalized tables, then there is no possibility of certain invalid/inconsistent representations in your database.  The data could be wrong, but certain invalid states will be impossible.\r\n\r\nThere are reason to denormalize a database, such as for a reporting database.  However, those have to do with differences in validity.  A sales rep, reports to a sales manager, who is in a sales division.  So, sales for that sales rep are under that sales manager, in that sales division.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the reporting database, for sales data for a year ago, that sales rep reported to a different sales manager, who was in a sales division which no longer exists.  You don&#39;t want to represent sales for that sales rep to be under their current manager in their current division.\r\n\r\nHere, having a denormalized dimension table, where sales rep records have fields for their sales manager at the time, and their division at the time makes sense.  Then a sales rep might have multiple records, each for their combination of manager and division at the time of their sales.\r\n\r\nSummary, what&#39;s important regarding normalization is the integrity of the data, which in some cases might suggest a kind of de-normalization under certain circumstances.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508975/should-i-denormalize-my-table-for-an-internal-search-engine/58512231#58512231","title":"Should I denormalize my table for an internal search engine?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12165231,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDsInVMH_kTskzoUtTk_MhBeHnYet_DKD6J1af-tw=k-s128","display_name":"Tyrone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12165231/tyrone"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571777916,"creation_date":1571763084,"question_id":58508975,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508975","body_markdown":"Right now I have 3 tables one for the sources I have, another for the keywords and a third that is the joining the keywords to sources.

Every type has one witness table per each protocol it conforms to, and a witness table has one entry per each function required by that protocol.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a variable whose type is an *existential* (i.e. not statically known), Swift stores that variable in a runtime structure called an *existential container*. TypeLayout.rst describes the format of an existential container:\r\n\r\n&gt; ### [Opaque Existential Containers](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABI/TypeLayout.rst#opaque-existential-containers)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If there is no class constraint on a protocol or protocol composition\r\n&gt; type, the existential container has to accommodate a value of\r\n&gt; arbitrary size and alignment. It does this using a **fixed-size buffer**,\r\n&gt; which is three pointers in size and pointer-aligned. This either\r\n&gt; directly contains the value, if its size and alignment are both less\r\n&gt; than or equal to the fixed-size buffer&#39;s, or contains a pointer to a\r\n&gt; side allocation owned by the existential container. The type of the\r\n&gt; contained value is identified by its type metadata record, and witness\r\n&gt; tables for all of the required protocol conformances are included. The\r\n&gt; layout is as if declared in the following C struct:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     struct OpaqueExistentialContainer {\r\n&gt;       void *fixedSizeBuffer[3];\r\n&gt;       Metadata *type;\r\n&gt;       WitnessTable *witnessTables[NUM_WITNESS_TABLES];\r\n&gt;     };\r\n\r\nThe `witnessTables` array contains one entry for each protocol that our existential is **statically** known to conform to -- so if our variable has type `P1 &amp; P2`, the existential will contain exactly two witness table pointers (an existential container is specific to its protocol constraints, so any extra protocols the concrete type conforms to are ignored). As long as we have a witness table describing a type&#39;s conformance to a protocol, we can create an existential container, pass it around, and use the witness table to call protocol methods.\r\n\r\nSo how do we add a conformance to a type via an extension? Well, we don&#39;t actually have to modify any properties of the type itself; we just need to create a new witness table. In order to implement dynamic casting between existential types, we need some way to register the conformance with the Swift runtime; this is done by placing a *protocol conformance record* within a designated section of the binary where the runtime knows to look for it:\r\n\r\n&gt; ### [Protocol Conformance Records](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABI/TypeMetadata.rst#protocol-conformance-records)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A *protocol conformance record* states that a given type conforms to a\r\n&gt; particular protocol. Protocol conformance records are emitted into\r\n&gt; their own section, which is scanned by the Swift runtime when needed\r\n&gt; (e.g., in response to a swift_conformsToProtocol() query). Each\r\n&gt; protocol conformance record contains:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The [protocol descriptor](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABI/TypeMetadata.rst#protocol-descriptor) describing the protocol of the conformance, represented as an (possibly indirect) 32-bit offset\r\n&gt; relative to the field. The low bit indicates whether it is an indirect\r\n&gt; offset; the second lowest bit is reserved for future use.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - A reference to the **conforming type**, represented as a 32-bit offset relative to the field. The lower two bits indicate how the conforming\r\n&gt; type is represented:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;   - 0: A direct reference to a nominal type descriptor.\r\n&gt;   - 1: An indirect reference to a nominal type descriptor.\r\n&gt;   - 2: Reserved for future use.\r\n&gt;   - 3: A reference to a pointer to an Objective-C class object.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The **witness table field** that provides access to the witness table describing the conformance itself, represented as a direct 32-bit\r\n&gt; relative offset. The lower two bits indicate how the witness table is\r\n&gt; represented:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  - 0: The witness table field is a reference to a witness table.\r\n&gt;  - 1: The witness table field is a reference to a witness table accessor function for an unconditional conformance.\r\n&gt;  - 2: The witness table field is a reference to a witness table accessor function for a conditional conformance.\r\n&gt;  - 3: Reserved for future use.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - A 32-bit value reserved for future use.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58508960/how-does-swift-achieve-extensions-at-the-machine-code-level/58512839#58512839","title":"How does Swift achieve extensions at the machine code level?"}],"owner":{"reputation":917,"user_id":4254252,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c50cfc28626aa6c326b97148bb60f19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fishy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4254252/fishy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":917,"user_id":4254252,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c50cfc28626aa6c326b97148bb60f19?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Fishy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4254252/fishy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58512839,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571781559,"creation_date":1571762982,"last_edit_date":1571778319,"question_id":58508960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58508960","body_markdown":"I am messing around with LLVM right now, and the question came to my mind: How is Swift able to achieve extensions at the binary level?\r\n\r\nIn Swift, one can provide a basic extension that simply adds methods, but they can also provide an extension that conforms to another protocol.
