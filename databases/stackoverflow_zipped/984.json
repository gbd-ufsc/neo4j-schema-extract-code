it is the same Science course as SICP does it is not vanilla SICP as the magicians did it. Brian Harvey has clearly used some procedures he is using in another book ha has on Scheme, called Simply Scheme ([free pdf online][1] | [Amazon][2]).\r\n\r\nIn it he uses the terms words and sentences and makes procedure that is kind of object oriented in the way that `(first var)` will return the first letter if `var` is either a string or symbol or the first &quot;word&quot; (element) if it is a list. In fear of violating copyright it&#39;s defined on page 531 in the PDF version.\r\n\r\nAnyway it is not standard so in order for it to work he either has loaded the procedures or made an ini file that defines them at startup. In Racket you can do the same by creating your own language or requiring a library. Sure enough someone has taken the time to create it as a language in Racket so you can do this:\r\n\r\n    #lang simply-scheme\r\n    (se (butlast (bf &quot;this&quot;))\r\n        &quot;world&quot;)\r\n\r\nThe first time you run this it will ask in the bottom to install Simply Scheme. Just press Install and the run once more once it is finished. \r\n\r\nWhile I have nothing against Brian Harvey I don&#39;t believe this is better than the original SICP ([videos][3] | [html book][4] | [webpage with resources][5]) that also has [their own language][6] in DrRacket. \r\n\r\nNote that none of these will be compatible with modern Scheme. Some of the procedures has altered contract, changed name or been totally replaced. Compare it with trying to learn English by reading Shakespeare in the way that the grammar won&#39;t help you.\r\n\r\nOther resources like this as How to design programs ([html book][7]), Rackets own and recommended book and, my favorite, Realm of Racket ([web page][8]).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://vinss.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/simply-scheme-mit-press_lk.pdf\r\n  [2]: https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Scheme-Introducing-Computer-Science/dp/0262082810\r\n  [3]: https://youtu.be/-J_xL4IGhJA\r\n  [4]: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html\r\n  [5]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/\r\n  [6]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19546115/which-lang-packet-is-proper-for-sicp-in-dr-racket/19561746#19561746\r\n  [7]: https://htdp.org/\r\n  [8]: https://www.realmofracket.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308445/scheme-contract-violation-in-drracket/58309104#58309104","title":"Scheme contract violation in DrRacket"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":4628703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBcvH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ravinki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4628703/ravinki"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58309104,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570640973,"creation_date":1570638254,"question_id":58308445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308445","body_markdown":"I am following Brian Harvey’s SICP lectures at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_l28HAzKy0N8 &quot;Computer Science 61A - Lecture 1: functional programming 1&quot;) I am using the DrRacket v7.4 IDE to write my Scheme code.\r\nAt 06:39 Professor Brian Harvey shows how to select the first character of a string.

What you want is to enter nested event loops, not use blocking mechanisms. From reading the API it also appears you are over-complicating things. Again, all you need is to enter a nested event loop on one UI thread and then exit that loop once the other UI thread has completed its work. I believe the following meets your requirements:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\r\nimport java.awt.SecondaryLoop;\r\nimport java.awt.Toolkit;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;\r\nimport java.util.function.Supplier;\r\nimport javafx.application.Platform;\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n\r\npublic class Foo {\r\n\r\n    public static &lt;T&gt; T getOnFxAndWaitOnEdt(Supplier&lt;? extends T&gt; supplier) {\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull(supplier, &quot;supplier&quot;);\r\n        if (!EventQueue.isDispatchThread()) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;current thread != EDT&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        final SecondaryLoop loop = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()\r\n                .getSystemEventQueue()\r\n                .createSecondaryLoop();\r\n        final AtomicReference&lt;T&gt; valueRef = new AtomicReference&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        Platform.runLater(() -&gt; {\r\n            valueRef.set(supplier.get());\r\n            SwingUtilities.invokeLater(loop::exit);\r\n        });\r\n        loop.enter();\r\n\r\n        return valueRef.get();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static &lt;T&gt; T getOnEdtAndWaitOnFx(Supplier&lt;? extends T&gt; supplier) {\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull(supplier, &quot;supplier&quot;);\r\n        if (!Platform.isFxApplicationThread()) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\r\n                    &quot;current thread != JavaFX Application Thread&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        final Object key = new Object();\r\n        final AtomicReference&lt;T&gt; valueRef = new AtomicReference&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n            valueRef.set(supplier.get());\r\n            Platform.runLater(() -&gt; Platform.exitNestedEventLoop(key, null));\r\n        });\r\n        Platform.enterNestedEventLoop(key);\r\n\r\n        return valueRef.get();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Platform#enterNestedEventLoop` and `Platform#exitNestedEventLoop` methods were added in JavaFX 9 though there are equivalent internal methods in JavaFX 8. The reason `AtomicReference` is used is because local variables must be final or effectively final when used inside a lambda expression. However, due to the way the separate threads are notified I don&#39;t believe the volatility semantics provided by the `#get()` and `#set(T)` methods of `AtomicReference` is strictly needed but I&#39;ve used those methods just in case.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of using the above to show a modal JavaFX dialog from the _Event Dispatch Thread_:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nOptional&lt;T&gt; optional = Foo.getOnFxAndWaitOnEdt(() -&gt; {\r\n    Dialog&lt;T&gt; dialog = new Dialog&lt;&gt;();\r\n    // configure dialog...\r\n    return dialog.showAndWait();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe above utility methods are for communicating from the _Event Dispatch Thread_ to the _JavaFX Application Thread_ and vice versa. This is why entering a nested event loop is necessary, otherwise one of the UI threads would have to block and that would freeze the associated UI. If you&#39;re on a non-UI thread and need to run an action on a UI thread while waiting for the result the solution is much simpler:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Run on EDT\r\nT result = CompletableFuture.supplyAysnc(/*Supplier*/, SwingUtilities::invokeLater).join();\r\n\r\n// Run on FX thread\r\nT result = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(/*Supplier*/, Platform::runLater).join();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call to `join()` will block the calling thread so be sure not to call the method from either of the UI threads.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308411/creating-an-event-dispatch-thread-safe-semaphore/58312635#58312635","title":"Creating an Event Dispatch Thread safe semaphore"}],"owner":{"reputation":197,"user_id":2423283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75057ee1361d4d3d169413ed4d8e88f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"NateW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2423283/natew"},"last_editor":{"reputation":154988,"user_id":418556,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOfDr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew Thompson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418556/andrew-thompson"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58312635,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570862811,"creation_date":1570638139,"last_edit_date":1570862811,"question_id":58308411,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308411","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to make a binary semaphore that will be able to safely block execution of a method running on the event dispatch thread (EDT) without actually blocking the thread from handling more events. This may initially seem impossible, but Java has some built-in functionality related to this, but I can&#39;t quite get it to work.\r\n\r\n# Use Case\r\nCurrently, if you show a modal swing dialog from the EDT, it will appear to block the EDT (because your method that displayed the modal dialog will not continue onto the next line until the dialog is closed), but really there&#39;s some under-the-hood magic that makes the EDT enter a new event loop which will continue to dispatch events until the modal dialog is closed.\r\n\r\nMy team currently has applications that are very slowly migrating from swing to JavaFX (a somewhat tricky transition) and I wanted to be able to display modal JavaFX dialogs from the AWT event dispatch thread in the same way that swing modal dialogs can be shown. It seemed like having some sort of EDT-safe semaphore would meet this use case and likely come in handy for other uses down the road.\r\n\r\n# Approach\r\n`java.awt.EventQueue.createSecondaryLoop()` is a method that creates a `SecondaryLoop` object, which you can then use to kick off a new event handling loop. When you call `SecondaryLoop.enter()`, the call will block while it processes a new event loop (note that the *call* blocks, but the *thread* is not blocked because it is continuing in an event processing loop). The new event loop will continue until you call `SecondaryLoop.exit()` (that&#39;s not entirely true, see my [related SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58192008/secondaryloop-enter-not-blocking-until-exit-is-called-on-the-edt)). \r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve created a semaphore where a blocking call to acquire results in waiting on a latch for a normal thread, or entering a secondary loop for the EDT. Each blocking call to acquire also adds an unblocking operation to be called when the semaphore is freed (for a normal thread, it just decrements the latch, for the EDT, it exits the secondary loop).\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\r\nimport java.awt.SecondaryLoop;\r\nimport java.awt.Toolkit;\r\nimport java.util.Stack;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;\r\n\r\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\r\npublic class EventDispatchThreadSafeBinarySemaphore extends Semaphore{\r\n\t\r\n\t/** Operations used to unblock threads when a semaphore is released.\r\n\t * Must be a stack because secondary loops have to be exited in the\r\n\t * reverse of the order in which they were entered in order to unblock\r\n\t * the execution of the method that entered the loop.\r\n\t */\r\n\tprivate Stack&lt;Runnable&gt;

I believe that I know why. I dug into the Java source code and in `WaitDispatchSupport` (the concrete implementation of `SecondaryLoop`), the loop basically continues dispatching events until a flag called `keepBlockingEDT` is cleared. It will check this between events. When I call `exit`, it will clear that flag and send an event to wakeup the event queue in case it was waiting for more events. However, it will not cause the `enter()` method to immediately exit (and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyway it possibly could).\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s how the deadlock results:\r\n\r\n* The main thread acquires the semaphore\r\n* The EDT thread tries to acquire the semaphore, but it is already acquired, so it:\r\n    * Creates a new secondary loop\r\n    * Creates a Runnable that will exit the new secondary loop and pushes it to the `releaseOperations` stack\r\n    * Enters the secondary loop, causing execution to block (note that this last step is by necessity outside of the `synchronized` block\r\n* The main thread releases the semaphore, which causes the following to happen:\r\n    * The `releaseOperations` stack is popped and it calls `exit` on the secondary loop\r\n    * The `exit` call, sets the `keepBlockingEDT` flag for that secondary loop to be set to false\r\n* Back in the EDT, it just got done checking the `keepBlockingEDT` flag (right before it was set to false) and it is fetching the next event.\r\n* It turns out that the next event is another runnable that blocks on the semaphore, so it tries to acquire it\r\n* This creates another `SecondaryLoop` on top of the original `SecondaryLoop` and enters it\r\n* At this point, the original `SecondaryLoop` has already had it&#39;s `keepBlockingEDT` flag cleared and it would be able to stop blocking, except that it is currently blocked running the second `SecondaryLoop`. The second `SecondaryLoop` won&#39;t ever have exit called on it because no one actually has the semaphore acquired right now, therefore we block forever.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been working on this for a few days and every idea I come up with is a dead end.\r\n\r\nI believe that I have a possible partial solution, which is to simply not allow more than one thread to be blocked on the semaphore at a time (if another thread tries to acquire it, I&#39;ll just throw an IllegalStateException). I could still have multiple secondary loops going if they each use their own semaphore, but each semaphore would create at most 1 secondary loop. I think this would work and it will meet my most likely use case just fine (because mostly I just want to show a single JavaFX modal dialog from the event thread). I just wanted to know if anyone else had other ideas because I feel like I got close to making something pretty cool, but it just doesn&#39;t quite work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any ideas. And &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure this is impossible and here&#39;s why...&quot; is an acceptable answer as well.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308411/creating-an-event-dispatch-thread-safe-semaphore","title":"Creating an Event Dispatch Thread safe semaphore"},{"tags":["aws-lambda","amazon-cloudformation","aws-amplify","amazon-dynamodb-streams"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10717632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f47083ff7cdaff833408d7941c0135e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Florian Fuchs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10717632/florian-fuchs"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570638135,"creation_date":1570638135,"question_id":58308410,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308410","body_markdown":"I&#180;m trying to get the ARN from a DynmoDB table created with `@model` from the api category. \r\n\r\nThe ARN is an output from the autogenerated cloudformation template under `/amplify/backend/api/{api-name}/build/stacks`. \r\n\r\nI tried to import the ARN with the following statement in the EventSourceMapping for my Lambda function: \r\n\r\n    &quot;EventSourceArn&quot;: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&quot;Fn::ImportValue&quot;: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;Fn::Join&quot;: [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;:&quot;,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;Ref&quot;: &quot;apiGraphQLAPIIdOutput&quot;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;GetAtt&quot;,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;CustomerTable&quot;,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;StreamArn&quot;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\r\nBut this throws the an error when pushing to the cloud: \r\n\r\n`Output &#39;GetAttCustomerTableStreamArn&#39;

we are using XPath 1.0\r\n\r\nTo get the Match and load the fields, I have set:\r\n\r\n    /root/items/item/extension_attributes/coaf\r\n\r\nAnd within the value field, I have placed something like a simple translate to make sure all is being found correctly:\r\n\r\n    translate(/root/items/item/extension_attributes/coaf, &#39;attribute_code{}&quot;attribute_id&#39;,&#39;&#39;)\r\n\r\nWhich

the extra information, especially because the value field within this program we are using is (currently) limited to 100 characters. So a lengthy replace line to get all the extra information would likely go over the character count.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best way to shed all the unnecessary information and essentially just retain the important fields like only keeping label:title1 &amp; value:value1 and label:title2 &amp; value:value2 ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308398/using-xpath-functions-to-clear-unnecessary-information","title":"Using XPath Functions to Clear Unnecessary Information"},{"tags":["json","rest","api","google-cloud-firestore","postman"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1598889,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eab1940ca6af47da47a1cac3417e32f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gerry St.Pierre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1598889/gerry-st-pierre"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570650598,"creation_date":1570650598,"answer_id":58311318,"question_id":58308396,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311318","body_markdown":"Something like the below should work.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is an &quot;update&quot; action is creates new documents as well if they don&#39;t exist.

I am hoping to use fluent api in some way (I know I said code first, but it&#39;s a strange variation of it where we change the schema and then adapt the application, don&#39;t ask lol). I would like a little more than just updating all our queries with joins. I know all the queries will need to be updated, but I&#39;d like to have the option of just adding .Include(x =&gt; x.LocalizedData).\r\n\r\nBut to get the data from the application we would need the Id (from the member table), GroupName (a string we define based on the tables we&#39;re essentially replacing, something like &quot;MemberStatus&quot;) and a languageId (this we store in the user session).\r\n    \r\nAny thoughts, suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: So far, I haven&#39;t come up with a solution. But this might be a way to articulate what I want to do:\r\n\r\n    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Parent&gt;()\r\n        .Property(p =&gt; p.ChildData.GroupName == &quot;Parent&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;LocalizedData&gt;()\r\n        .Property(p =&gt; p.LanguageId == 2);// the current language selected\r\n    \r\n    modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Parent&gt;()\r\n        .Property(p =&gt; p.ChildData)\r\n        .HasForeignKey(p =&gt; p.StatusId);\r\n\r\nObviously, this doesn&#39;t work. But the idea was that the top one tells EF that a the relationship of parent to child has a filtering that the GroupName is specific for that particular group. The second tells EF we will only want results that have a language id that matches the current language in the users session and the last one tells EF that child data needs to use the StatusId property for the foreign key. Hopefully this is more verbose and makes the issue more clear. I certainly would like to figure this one out.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308376/relationships-for-localization-tables-in-net","title":"Relationships for Localization Tables in .NET"},{"tags":["batch-file","command-line","ffmpeg","comments","line-continuation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20441,"user_id":6738015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYDxX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Compo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6738015/compo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570640505,"post_id":58308375,"comment_id":102979438,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308375/how-to-write-comments-in-batch-files-for-ffmpeg#comment102979438_58308375"},{"owner":{"reputation":22416,"user_id":5047996,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/la3kD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"aschipfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5047996/aschipfl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570646088,"post_id":58308375,"comment_id":102982050,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308375/how-to-write-comments-in-batch-files-for-ffmpeg#comment102982050_58308375"},{"owner":{"reputation":22416,"user_id":5047996,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/la3kD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"aschipfl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5047996/aschipfl"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":20441,"user_id":6738015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYDxX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Compo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6738015/compo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570646251,"post_id":58308375,"comment_id":102982137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308375/how-to-write-comments-in-batch-files-for-ffmpeg#comment102982137_58308375"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":107330,"user_id":1012053,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDAXz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dbenham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1012053/dbenham"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107330,"user_id":1012053,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDAXz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dbenham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1012053/dbenham"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570706669,"last_edit_date":1570706669,"creation_date":1570654120,"answer_id":58312070,"question_id":58308375,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312070","body_markdown":"    C:\\some_location\\ffmpeg.exe ^\r\n    -i input_file -vsync cfr %= COMMENT_01 =% ^\r\n    -map 0:v %= COMMENT_02 =% ^\r\n    -r 24000/1001 %= COMMENT_03 =% ^\r\n    -pix_fmt yuv444p10le %= COMMENT_04 =% ^\r\n    -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 4444 %= COMMENT_05 =% ^\r\n    -map_metadata -1 %= COMMENT_06 =% ^\r\n    output_file\r\n\r\nTreat expansion of an undefined variable as a comment (expands to nothing).\r\n\r\nLine continuation `^` must be the last character on the line.

It would be like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped table-sm&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;thead&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n      &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n      &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr&gt;\r\n       ...\r\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nAs recommended to be responsive, you can use `.table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}` as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint.

code should avoid using the `onchange` attribute with the `ng-model` directive. The `ng-if` directive uses alot of resources. If the only reason it is being used is to switch the `ng-change` function, it should be avoided. The choice of `ng-change` function can be made in the controller.\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot; ng-repeat=&quot;product in oc.itemdetail.lines&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;-&quot; class=&quot;minus&quot;\r\n               ng-click=&quot;oc.decrement(product)&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;input  type=&quot;number&quot;  ng-model=&quot;product.line.total&quot; min=&quot;&quot; max=&quot;&quot; \r\n                step=&quot;product.stepCount&quot; ng-change=&quot;oc.update(product)&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;+&quot; class=&quot;plus&quot;\r\n               ng-click=&quot;oc.increment(product)&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nAvoid complex formulations in templates. Instead put them in the controller:\r\n\r\n    oc.update = function(product) {\r\n       if (oc.&lt;condition 1&gt;) {\r\n         oc.function1();\r\n       };\r\n       if (oc.&lt;condition 2&gt;) {\r\n         oc.function2();\r\n       };\r\n    };\r\n          \r\nFor performance reasons, avoid using watchers. Instead use the functions that change the model to invoke update operations:\r\n\r\n    oc.decrement = function(product) {\r\n        product.line.total = product.line.total - product.stepCount;\r\n        oc.update(product);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    oc.increment = function(product) {\r\n        product.line.total = product.line.total + product.stepCount;\r\n        oc.update(product);\r\n    };\r\n\r\nPutting complex expressions in the controller makes the code easier to understand, debug, test, and maintain.

Now whenever ng-model updates either by clicking +/- button I want to fire ng-change. I understand that ng-change doesn&#39;t fire when the ng-model updated programatically. But the refrenced Stackoverflow has solution for that to add $watch on the ng-model. But its working if I create separate controller, not working inside current controller. ng-change is calling functions inside current controller.

The second row shows dividers with `gravity=&quot;center_horizontal&quot;` and this messes up the row, displacing it to the right. How can I prevent this?\r\n\r\nThe reason I want to use both the centering and the dividers can be seen in the third and fourth rows: by using a `weightSum` of 2 I can make one button `GONE`, and thanks to the `gravity` the button would center in the middle (fourth row). But the dividers are breaking the centering (and layout in general), so there is not much use if I have to keep track of both things.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to make dividers work with gravity?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Your example is however not one of them.\r\n\r\nIf, using your example, I would need a single class that encapsulates both ingredients, this is how I would approach this:\r\n\r\n    class CombinedItem {\r\n       private menuItems: HasPrice[];\r\n       constructor(menuItems: hasPrice[]) {\r\n          this.menuItems = menuItems;\r\n       }\r\n       getPrice() {\r\n          return this.menuItems.reduce(\r\n             (acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr.getPrice(),\r\n             0\r\n          );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis could then be constructed as such:\r\n\r\n    const item = new CombinedItem([\r\n       new Rice(),\r\n       new Chicken()\r\n    ]);\r\n\r\nCombinedItem is a class that can take any combination of inputs. If you want something really specific, you can do:\r\n\r\n    class ChickenAndRice {\r\n       private chicken: Chicken;\r\n       private rice: Rice;\r\n       constructor(chicken: Chicken, rice: Rice) {\r\n          this.chicken = chicken;\r\n          this.rice = rice;\r\n       }\r\n       getPrice() {\r\n          return this.chicken.getPrice() + this.rice.getPrice();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m not sure why you would ever want this.\r\n\r\nThinking in the direction of inheritance for your problem is a common mistake, and right solution is to compose objects and classes together instead of inherit behavior.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308325/typescript-multiple-class-inheritance-design/58313805#58313805","title":"Typescript multiple class inheritance design"}],"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":5571752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36532a97d78017788ae0708fa8c81738?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"atul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5571752/atul"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58313805,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570666597,"creation_date":1570637815,"question_id":58308325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308325","body_markdown":"I am designing a Menu system for a restaurent in Typescript.

It&#39;s in the standard, that&#39;s what makes a forward iterator, well, a forward iterator. `std::next` is not a customization point. It provides an alternative way of getting a new instance of the pseudo-iterator object, usually when the pseudo-iterator either is not a class, or doesn&#39;t provide operators, or has no methods, etc. If the &quot;pseudo&quot;-iterator object type itself provides the increment operator, then it cannot be safely treated like a pseudo-iterator. It must either adhere to the contract of the relevant iterator, or you must not use it like it was an iterator: **it isn&#39;t!** Instead, provide a wrapper. Merely providing `next` as a &quot;customization&quot; is likely not enough, so the design prevents you from assuming that it&#39;s enough: you have to do more work anyway, since you need to examine the pseudo-iterator object&#39;s API to wrap it.\r\n\r\n&gt; And any idea how could I inject my code right before every call to operator++() then?\r\n\r\nUse your own iterators. They can wrap whatever pseudo-iterator object is provided by the third-party library you&#39;re using.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with such customization points is that not only range-for would be using them, so whatever side effects you wish to add for the purpose of range-for, will break other things, and quite possibly you&#39;ll have large projects with hundreds of latent bugs that way, and unrelated changes will make the whole thing blow up.\r\n\r\nThe wrapper class should provide the functionality that&#39;s needed, and then if some new use case comes up, it won&#39;t compile, and the wrapper will have to be extended. This way the latent bugs won&#39;t be a problem (assuming that you have sufficient coverage in the unit tests for the wrapper).\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s clear that whatever the third-party object returns as its &quot;iterator&quot; is not really the iterator you want. Thus wrap it so that it works for you. It&#39;s really easy.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308318/range-for-loops-not-using-stdnext-by-default/58309209#58309209","title":"Range-for loops not using std::next by default?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1909,"user_id":3074280,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8pIgB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"nyarlathotep108","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3074280/nyarlathotep108"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":88,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570694748,"creation_date":1570637789,"question_id":58308318,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308318","body_markdown":"I am surprised that by default a range-based for loop is missing the customization point of calling `std::next` on the iterator returned by `std::begin` and is instead directly calling `operator++()`:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    struct Iterator {\r\n        Iterator&amp; operator++()\r\n        {\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            ++i;\r\n            return *this;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        int operator*()\r\n        {\r\n            return i;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        int i;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    bool operator!=(const Iterator&amp; lhs, const Iterator&amp; rhs)\r\n    {\r\n        return lhs.i != rhs.i;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Iterator&amp; next(Iterator&amp; it)\r\n    {\r\n        // this is where I need to injext my code :/\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n        return ++it;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct Container {\r\n    \r\n        Iterator begin() { return { 0 }; }\r\n        Iterator end() { return { 10 }; }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        Container con;\r\n    \r\n        for (const auto&amp; elem : con) {\r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAny idea why this decision has been made?

For example:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// valid\r\nFoo::queryType()-&gt;take(5)-&gt;skip(50)-&gt;get();\r\n\r\n// invalid, missing query type\r\nFoo::take-&gt;(5)-&gt;get();\r\n```\r\n`Foo` is just a facade for accessing the library.  `queryType()` is a required initial method (can be one of many, e.g. `queryTypeA()`, `queryTypeB()`) that sets a protected class variable in `Foo`.  I want to throw an `Exception` if `get()` is called without that variable being set first.  And I want to be precise in what gets thrown.\r\n\r\nPHP&#39;s [documentation][1] lists a few options:\r\n\r\n - [`BadMethodCallException`][2]:\r\n&gt;Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some arguments are missing.\r\n\r\nProbably doesn&#39;t refer to missing prerequisites, and I get the feeling this is intended more for dynamic calls where the method doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\n - [`BadFunctionCallException`][3]\r\n&gt; Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined function or if some arguments are missing.\r\n\r\nBasically same as before but for general *functions*, and `BadMethodCallException` is actually a child class of this.\r\n\r\n - [`InvalidArgumentException`][4]\r\n&gt; Exception thrown if an argument is not of the expected type.\r\n\r\nWhile not technically an *argument*, an unset protected class variable required to continue execution fits the general idea, so this one makes the most sense so far.\r\n\r\n - [`UnexpectedValueException`][5]\r\n&gt; Exception thrown if a value does not match with a set of values. Typically this happens when a function calls another function and expects the return value to be of a certain type or value not including arithmetic or buffer related errors.\r\n\r\nNot really an option; while the name implies that I might want the opposite of this - I *expect* a value to be set and it&#39;s not present - the description seems less of a match than others, and there&#39;s no user contributed notes to help refine.\r\n\r\n - [`RuntimeException`][6]\r\n&gt; Exception thrown if an error which can only be found on runtime occurs.\r\n\r\nMy fallback.

However, when I run a fresh build, the ImageStream does not automatically sync up with the remote repo. New deployments use the old image until that occurs.

As the body which comes to your endpoint has no such a field, you need to add it manually.\r\n\r\nNormally, aggregated fields could be added with custom constructor of your DTO:\r\n```\r\nexport class CreateFolderDto {\r\n    public readonly name: string\r\n    public readonly session_uuid: string\r\n\r\n    constructor(bodyValue: any = {}) {\r\n       this.name = bodyValue.name\r\n       this.session_uuid = generateUuid()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in your case, `user` is attached to `request` itself, so I believe you have the following options:\r\n\r\n1. Check out your code which attaches the `user` to request itself. If you are using JWT Auth described in NestJS docs, you cannot do this that way.\r\n\r\n2. You can write custom Interceptor:\r\n```\r\nInjectable()\r\nexport class ExtendBodyWithUserId implements NestInterceptor {\r\n  async intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler) {\r\n    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest()\r\n    request.body.user_id = request.user\r\n    return next.handle()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// usage\r\n@UseGuards(AuthGuard(&#39;jwt&#39;))\r\n@UseInterceptors(ExtendBodyWithUserId)\r\n@Post()\r\npublic create(@Request() req, @Body() createFolderDto: CreateFolderDto) {\r\n    return this.folderService.create(createFolderDto)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast but not least, some personal recommendation. Consider how much you will use this interceptor as an extension, as too many of &#39;extras&#39; like this bloat the codebase. \r\n\r\nI would recommend to change the `folderService` signature to:\r\n`create(createFolderDto: CreateFolderDto, user: User)`, where folder dto has only the name, without user-related entry. You keep the consistency, separation and clear intentions. In the implementation of `create` you can just pass `user.id` further.\r\nAnd going this way, you don&#39;t have to write custom interceptors.\r\n\r\nPick your way and may the consistency in your codebase be with you!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308289/auto-fill-dto-fields-with-other-data-than-request-body-data/58352238#58352238","title":"Auto-fill DTO fields with other data than request body data"}],"owner":{"reputation":319,"user_id":5780212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03469d42bdf0d27e234dfbb03a4b5971?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rsommerard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5780212/rsommerard"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58352238,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570868415,"creation_date":1570637666,"question_id":58308289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308289","body_markdown":"I have a class `CreateFolderDto` with two readonly fields:\r\n\r\n    export class CreateFolderDto {\r\n        public readonly name: string\r\n        public readonly user_id: number\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have a controller which is:\r\n\r\n    @UseGuards(AuthGuard(&#39;jwt&#39;))\r\n    @Post()\r\n    public create(@Request() req, @Body() createFolderDto: CreateFolderDto) {\r\n        return this.folderService.create(createFolderDto)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe request send to my controller is a good one, I only send the `name` in `json` format with an `accessToken` in the header.

learning from @Lance&#39;s tips, I went ahead and checked `%userprofile%\\.nuget\\packages` folder, and indeed it contains all the packages that I have downloaded in the past. Unfortunately though, Visual Studio (I&#39;m using Community 2019) does not allow you to install any of these packages into a new project. The **Browse** page in NuGet Package Manager UI displays online results only from `nuget.org`.\r\n\r\nBut then I found another clue. In Visual Studio **Tools** &gt; **Options** &gt; **NuGet Package Manager** &gt; **Package Sources**, you can add custom sources. So I went ahead and added my cache folder as an alternate source.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNote that there is a separate &quot;Machine-wide package sources&quot; entry too that cannot be modified. I checked that folder and it contains mostly Microsoft&#39;s own packages (one exception that I found there was `NewtonSoft.json`). I have no idea how this folder is different from the nuget cache folder and how I can download a package to this folder.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The Package Manager now shows all previously downloaded packages from cache when I select this source from the drop down (sources dropdown is in top-right corner). I can then select a package and install it from local source instead of downloading it from the Internet.\r\n\r\nHope this helps someone down the line.\r\n \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bpsXd.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308275/global-package-installation-using-nuget/58310409#58310409","title":"Global package installation using NuGet"}],"owner":{"reputation":19843,"user_id":1137199,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/41GR5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dotNET","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1137199/dotnet"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58310409,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570646796,"creation_date":1570637618,"question_id":58308275,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308275","body_markdown":"Does NuGet support global package installation like NPM and Composer?

This, alone, does not apply the query filters to Entity Framework. Instead, it has the data layer retrieve *all* records and then applies the filter to the outgoing response. Ideally, the filters would be applied to the Entity Framework query to retrieve only those records needed to satisfy the request. Instead, if you use ODataQueryOptions as a parameter in your endpoint, you *can* apply the request filters to Entity Framework but the EnableQueryAttribute then re-applies the filters to the outgoing request.\r\n\r\n\r\ne.g. The following will retrieve all the records from a database call and then apply the &quot;skip&quot; record filter but properly generates the swagger document:\r\n```\r\n[EnableQuery(AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Top | AllowedQueryOptions.Skip)]\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetReadings(Guid key, ODataFilterOptions&lt;MyItem&gt; options) {\r\n return options.ApplyTo(DbContext.MyItems);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there are 18 results in your database and you supply &#39;10&#39; for the skip option, the results will be empty (the DB call filters the first 10 in the database call, then the EnableQuery attribute filters an additional 10 out of the outgoing request, leaving you with 0 results in the calling client).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following allows you to apply the ODataFilterOptions to the EntityFramework call, but will not generate the proper swagger document to generate client code from:\r\n```\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetReadings(Guid key, ODataFilterOptions&lt;MyItem&gt; options) {\r\n return options.ApplyTo(DbContext.MyItems);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally, the filters are applied at in the generated SQL call to eliminate bringing back more records than are necessary AND the swagger document is properly generated.

Max-pooling of average-pooling might make much more sense in this case than summing all the token embeddings.

Admin is not meant for that purpose**\r\n\r\nDjango Admin should only be used when the user has complete access to everything in the database. What they can edit can be restricted, but generally what they can see should not be. \r\n\r\n It’s not intended to allow much in terms of only allowing access to certain bits of data. It is recommended that you build a custom frontend for this purpose, where it is easy to do such restrictions. \r\n\r\nSuch restriction is easy in `views` and `templates`. Use `request.user`.\r\n\r\nI am on my phone right now, but if you want, I can post some sample code which does this. Just comment below. \r\n\r\nThese are samples from an `updateprofile` method which I have. \r\n\r\nThe core concept here is that the only data being sent to the form is that of the user of the account which is currently logged in. You would want to implement such functionality.\r\n\r\n**views.py checking for the correct user**\r\n```\r\n@login_required(login_url=&#39;/login&#39;)\r\ndef update_profile(request):\r\n    if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n        user_form = UserForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)\r\n        if user_form.is_valid():\r\n            user_form.save()\r\n            return redirect(&#39;/accounts/{}&#39;.format(request.user.username), request.user.username)\r\n        else:\r\n            print(&quot;Something broke&quot;)\r\n    else:\r\n        user_form = UserForm(instance=request.user) #grabbing the data from that specific user, making sure that is all that is passed. \r\n    return render(request, &#39;profile_update.html&#39;, {\r\n        &#39;user_form&#39;: user_form,\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the template, the if statement checks to see whether the user of the page is the owner of the logged in account (and checks that they are looed into their account) and if so, shows them the information. \r\n\r\n\r\n**template code for checking for the correct user**\r\n```\r\n    {% if page_username == user.username and user.is_authenticated %}\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever content you wanted to show to the user who owned the page and was logged in.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n{% else %}\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you want to say to users who are not authorized to view the data on the page, if anything.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n{% endif %}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308251/how-to-add-permissions-to-edit-own-in-django-admin-based-on-value-in-model/58308535#58308535","title":"How to add permissions to edit own in django admin based on value in model?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12049004,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cecf3331e1cd2ec74bab3b08597dc198?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"webmourek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12049004/webmourek"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58308535,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570659955,"creation_date":1570637507,"question_id":58308251,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308251","body_markdown":"I have a question about Django-Admin.
