better approach would be to split up the calculation into parts and follow the BEDMAS rule:\r\n\r\n1. B: Extract and process items in brackets first. Keep going down into nested brackets until there are no more.\r\n2. E: Process items with exponents next.\r\n3. D: Process all items either side of the division symbol in turn.\r\n4. M: Process all items either side of the multiplication symbol in turn.\r\n5. A: Process all items either side of the addition symbol in turn.\r\n6. S: Process all items either side of the subtraction symbol in turn.\r\n7. If within a nested bracket, go up one level and continue at step 2. Replace the nested bracket with the result of the calculations within that backet.\r\n8. Keep repeating cyclically through the &quot;tree&quot; of brackets until you are done.\r\n\r\nThis is a VERY general overview of a basic calculator by simply flattening all the items until you get the final value (assuming there are no variables of course ;)).\r\n\r\nHere is a way to get started:\r\n\r\nvar mathParts = &quot;1 + 2 - ((3 + (2 * 3 / 3)) * 5^2) / 6&quot;.match(/[0-9()^\\/*+-]/g);\r\n\r\nmathParts: (23)&#160;[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;6&quot;]\r\n\r\nNow all you have to do is iterate over the array (`mathParts`) and increment your nesting level each time you hit `(` and decrement the level each time you hit `)`. After that use multiple passes: first pass (or loop) handle exponents (`^`), then `/` on the next pass, then `*` on the next, then `+`, then `-`.\r\n\r\nIf you only run this client side, and strip out all non-math characters (don&#39;t allow $_AtoZ[]) and allow symbols needed for math only, then it should also be safe enough to simply use `eval()` to do the calculation. It is safe if used correctly, and only by the user of the webpage at the client side, since those same users can already press F12 and hack the site if they wanted to; thus, protecting from eval is pointless in that context. I would suggest if you go that route to run `eval()` within a `new Function(&quot;eval()&quot;)` scope so it runs at the global level and not within the scope of your own code (to keep private things private).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210531/is-there-a-way-to-solve-a-math-problem-from-a-user-prompt-input/58210615#58210615","title":"Is there a way to solve a math problem from a user prompt input"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":11535823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b83d895df7b46ccac4fe6337bfa28229?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11535823/tmanrocks994"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570152124,"post_id":58210768,"comment_id":102832255,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210531/is-there-a-way-to-solve-a-math-problem-from-a-user-prompt-input/58210768#comment102832255_58210768"},{"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":69,"user_id":11535823,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b83d895df7b46ccac4fe6337bfa28229?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11535823/tmanrocks994"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195340,"post_id":58210768,"comment_id":102847367,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210531/is-there-a-way-to-solve-a-math-problem-from-a-user-prompt-input/58210768#comment102847367_58210768"},{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11487730,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08fbbfc9c8795e8542f4f9f93d88a7a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks999","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11487730/tmanrocks999"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571096892,"post_id":58210768,"comment_id":103118483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210531/is-there-a-way-to-solve-a-math-problem-from-a-user-prompt-input/58210768#comment103118483_58210768"},{"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11487730,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08fbbfc9c8795e8542f4f9f93d88a7a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks999","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11487730/tmanrocks999"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571098355,"post_id":58210768,"comment_id":103118774,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210531/is-there-a-way-to-solve-a-math-problem-from-a-user-prompt-input/58210768#comment103118774_58210768"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570060930,"creation_date":1570060930,"answer_id":58210768,"question_id":58210531,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210768","body_markdown":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/calculator-scripts\r\n\r\nnode module\r\n\r\nwhy write it all yourself when there is a module.

You can get the `DbConnection` object from the EF Context using `context.Database.GetDbConnection()` \r\n\r\n  *Pros:* Migration code will never need to be changed\r\n\r\n  *Cons:* You won&#39;t get any of the benefits of EF Core\r\n\r\n2. **Perform Data Migrations After Schema Migrations**\r\n\r\n\r\n  EF performs migrations in the ascending order of the `MigrationAttribute.Id` string value.  EF generates this based off a timestamp when calling `dotnet ef migrations add xxx`.  You can change this attribute to ensure Data Migrations are run after all Schema Migrations.  Change the filename as well for readability so that they stay in the order they will be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *Pros:* You get all the benefits of EF Core\r\n\r\n  *Cons:* If the schema changes in the future, such as removing a column referenced in the data migration, you will need to modify your migration\r\n\r\n  Example `MigrationAttribute.Id` change:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// change\r\n[Migration(&quot;20191002171530_DataMigration&quot;)]\r\n// to\r\n[Migration(&quot;99999999000001_DataMigration&quot;)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-code-examples","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210485/entity-framework-core-earlier-data-migrations-break-when-models-are-changed/58224693#58224693","title":"Entity Framework Core - Earlier data migrations break when models are changed"}],"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":782012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/397ca0405e8096b3c3a7ca8fa376b553?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Becroft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/782012/daniel-becroft"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1288,"user_id":1419658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PBM6G3QRJUo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOw0/hGPjTuuiM74/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Caleb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1419658/caleb"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58224693,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570137482,"creation_date":1570058352,"last_edit_date":1570137482,"question_id":58210485,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210485","body_markdown":"We are starting a new application with with .NET Core, EF Core and Postgres - we&#39;re really liking the migrations :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;ve found a problem that I can&#39;t figure out how to work around. In some of our migrations, we use the `DbContext` to load records, run some business logic, and resave the records. We also run `database.Context.Migrate()` when the web server starts, so it always runs.\r\n\r\nThis all works fine (so far).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it works right up until the model is changed at a later point. Consider the following migration order:\r\n\r\n1. Create `Customer`, `Order`, and `OrderLine` models. Add the schema migrations to load the structures\r\n2. A business rule changes, so we need to set a value on the `Order` record based on some business logic . We create a data migration where we load the `DbContext`, run the code, and run `SaveChangesAsync()`\r\n\r\n  At this point, everything is fine.\r\n\r\n3. We need to add a schema migration with a new field to the `Customer` record.\r\n\r\nHere, things break. If the database has not had migration 2 applied, the `Migrate()` command errors as when applying migration 2, EF is trying to generate a select statement that includes the new field in 3. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure where the problem actually is in the process though: should we not be using the `DbContext` in the migration (and hand-code SQL statements)? Should we be explicitly be doing projections on every record read so that we know exactly what we&#39;re doing? \r\n\r\nSomething else?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210485/entity-framework-core-earlier-data-migrations-break-when-models-are-changed","title":"Entity Framework Core - Earlier data migrations break when models are changed"},{"tags":["php","html","mysql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11111282,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/62c08d52fbe40d27e8e136b144ee6760?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"G.

What else can I try to fix this?\r\n\r\nHere is the XML:\r\n\r\n    &lt;controls:DataGridTemplateColumn x:Name=&quot;markCompleteCol&quot; Header=&quot;Complete&quot; Tag=&quot;Complete&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\r\n              &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\r\n                 &lt;Button x:Name=&quot;markCompleteColButton&quot; Background=&quot;Transparent&quot; Visibility=&quot;{Binding Path=IsCompleted, \r\n                Converter={StaticResource inverseBoolToVisConverter}, ConverterParameter=false}&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; HorizontalContentAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; Click=&quot;MarkCompleteColButton_ClickAsync&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Button.Content&gt;\r\n                      &lt;StackPanel Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;&gt;\r\n                           &lt;Border CornerRadius=&quot;14&quot; \r\n                                   Background=&quot;{Binding Path=IsCompleted, Mode=OneWay, \r\n                                   Converter={StaticResource markCompleteButtonBackgroundColorFormatter}}&quot; \r\n                                   BorderBrush=&quot;{Binding Path=IsCompleted, Mode=OneWay, Converter={StaticResource markCompleteButtonOutlineColorFormatter}}&quot;\r\n                                    BorderThickness=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\r\n                             &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Path=IsCompleted, Mode=OneWay, Converter={StaticResource markCompleteButtonFormatter}}&quot; \r\n                                                   Margin=&quot;16, 5, 16, 5&quot;\r\n                                                   TextAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;\r\n                                                   Foreground=&quot;{Binding Path=IsCompleted, Mode=OneWay, Converter={StaticResource markCompleteButtonOutlineColorFormatter}}&quot;/&gt;\r\n                                &lt;/Border&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/Button.Content&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Button&gt;\r\n            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\r\n        &lt;/controls:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;\r\n    &lt;/controls:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;\r\n\r\nFrank","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210465/binding-fails-when-using-datatemplate-in-datagrid","title":"Binding fails when using DataTemplate in DataGrid"},{"tags":["android","android-activity","broadcastreceiver"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":2804622,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/837ba1994c8efa0aac0a51ddf209e063?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2804622","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2804622/user2804622"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570076775,"post_id":58211226,"comment_id":102801477,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210463/how-to-access-any-control-of-an-activity-from-a-broadcast-receiver-without-usin/58211226#comment102801477_58211226"},{"owner":{"reputation":72366,"user_id":1631193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87710a44c445623bcf914560c1a9d621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gabe Sechan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1631193/gabe-sechan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":2804622,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/837ba1994c8efa0aac0a51ddf209e063?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2804622","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2804622/user2804622"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570083884,"post_id":58211226,"comment_id":102803332,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210463/how-to-access-any-control-of-an-activity-from-a-broadcast-receiver-without-usin/58211226#comment102803332_58211226"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":72366,"user_id":1631193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87710a44c445623bcf914560c1a9d621?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gabe Sechan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1631193/gabe-sechan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570065846,"creation_date":1570065846,"answer_id":58211226,"question_id":58210463,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58211226","body_markdown":"You can&#39;t, and you shouldn&#39;t.  You have no assurance an Activity is running when a BroadcastReceiver runs.  If you need to do that, your application is misarchitected.  The only case where its ok is if the BroadcastReceiver is registered in the Activity and in that limited case you can either make the BR an inner class of the Activity (in which case it can access any variable of the Activity) or it can be passed the control when you instantiate it via its constructor.  But either way is dangerous, as either way can cause it to fire after the activity is finished if you&#39;re not careful about unregistration.\r\n\r\nDo not under any circumstance make a view a static variable.

Never the less, after 1-2 minutes I came up with 2 solutions with pros and cons, but I think one is perfect for you: \r\n\r\nA. When your threads are almost done the same time and or need their print ASAP you could use a shared `std::atomic&lt;T&gt;` with `T=unsigned,int,size_t,uint32_t` what ever you like, or any of the integer atomics in the C standard library when using C, initialise it with 0, and now every thread i busy waits until its value is i-1. If so, it prints and then adds 1 on the atomic. Of course since of the busy wait, you will have much CPU load when thread are waiting long, and slow down, when many are waiting. But you get your print ASAP\r\n\r\nB. You just store your result of thread i in a container, maybe along with its index, since I guess you want more to just print i, and after all threads are finished or periodically, sort this container and then print it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;atomic&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;thread&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n    \r\n    void thread_function(unsigned i, std::atomic&lt;unsigned&gt;&amp; atomic) {\r\n        while (atomic &lt; i - 1) {}\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;;\r\n        atomic += 1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        std::atomic&lt;unsigned&gt; atomic = 0;\r\n    \r\n        std::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; threads;\r\n        for (auto i : {3,1,2}) {\r\n            threads.push_back(std::thread(thread_function, i, std::ref(atomic)));\r\n        }\r\n        for (auto&amp; t : threads) {\r\n            t.join();\r\n        }\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWorks also in C, just use the atomics there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210460/c-c-single-semaphore-of-type-sem-t-to-print-numbers-in-order/58210601#58210601","title":"C/C++ - Single semaphore of type sem_t to print numbers in order"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1088,"user_id":1513773,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtUGB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"A.

And we want the threads to print the numbers in sorted order.\r\n\r\n**Trivial Solution (using n semaphore/mutex):** We can use n mutex locks (or similarly semaphores) where thread i waits to acquire mutex lock number i and unlocks number i + 1. Also, thread 1 has no wait.\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible to simulate a similar logic **using a single semaphore** (of type sem_t) to implement the following logic: (i is a number between 1 to n inclusive)\r\n\r\n&gt; Thread with number i as input, waits to acquire a count of (i-1) on the semaphore, and after\r\n&gt; printing, releases a count of i. Needless to say, thread one does not\r\n&gt; wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that unlike Java, sem_t does not support arbitrary increase/decrease in the semaphore value. Moreover, writing a for loop to do (i-1) wait and i release won&#39;t work because of asynchrony.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been looking for the answer for so long but couldn&#39;t find any. Is this possible in plain C? If not, is it possible in C++ using only one variable or semaphore? Overall, what is the least wasteful way to do this with ONE semaphore.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to edit the question since I&#39;m new to multi-threaded programming.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210460/c-c-single-semaphore-of-type-sem-t-to-print-numbers-in-order","title":"C/C++ -

The code is not complete to keep it simple. \r\n\r\n**Players and Player classes**\r\n\r\n    Public Class Players(Of TPlayer As {Player, New})\r\n    \r\n        Protected _players As List(Of TPlayer)\r\n    \r\n        Sub New()\r\n            _players = New List(Of TPlayer)\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n        Public Function GetByName(name As String) As TPlayer\r\n            Dim player As TPlayer = _players.Find(Function(p As TPlayer) p.Name = name)\r\n    \r\n            If player Is Nothing Then\r\n                &#39; Create player\r\n                player = New TPlayer\r\n                player.Name = name\r\n                _players.Add(player)\r\n            End If\r\n    \r\n            Return player\r\n    \r\n        End Function\r\n    \r\n    End Class\r\n    \r\n    Public Class Player\r\n        Public Property Name As String\r\n        Public Property Number As Integer\r\n    End Class\r\n\r\nAll of this seems good so far hopefully.

For `Baseball` Class: \r\n\r\n&gt; Type argument &#39;BaseballTeams&#39; does not inherit from or implement the\r\n&gt; constraint type &#39;Teams(Of Team(Of Players(Of Player)))&#39;\r\n\r\n 2. For `Baseball` Class: \r\n\r\n&gt; Type argument &#39;BaseballPlayers&#39; does not inherit from or implement the\r\n&gt; constraint type &#39;Players(Of Player)&#39;\r\n\r\n 3.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading my question.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Edit 1**: I have tried passing all types directly into the Sport class definition:\r\n\r\n    Public Class Sport(Of TTeams As {Teams(Of TTeam, TPlayers), New}, TTeam As Team(Of TPlayers), TPlayers As {Players(Of TPlayer), New}, TPlayer As {Player, New})\r\n        Public Teams As New TTeams\r\n        Public Players As New TPlayers\r\n    End Class\r\n\r\nand this:\r\n\r\n    Public Class Teams(Of TTeam As {Team(Of TPlayers), New}, TPlayers As Players(Of TPlayer), TPlayer As Player)\r\n\r\nI was hoping that I could simplify the declaration by defining the types within the declaration itself. This is not getting me any further, just giving more errors.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210427/type-argument-does-not-inherit-from-or-implement-the-constraint-type-error","title":"Type argument does not inherit from or implement

few possible things going on here:\r\n\r\n1. Regardless of you writing `&quot;0&quot;` here, the reading function (`fread`) is inferring based on looking at a portion of the file. This is not uncommon (`readr` does it, too), and is controllable (with `colClasses=`).\r\n\r\n2. This might be unique to your question here (and not your real data), but your call to `write.csv` is implicitly putting the literal `NA` letters in the file (not to be confused with `&quot;NA&quot;` where you have the literal string). This might be confusing things, even when you override with `colClasses=`.\r\n\r\n3. You might already know this, but since `fread` is inferring that those columns are really `integer` classes, then they cannot contain empty strings: once determined to be a number column, anything non-number-like will be `NA`.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s redo your first csv-generating side to make sure we don&#39;t confound the situation.\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nwrite.csv(matrix(c(&quot;0&quot;,&quot;&quot;,NA,&quot;NA&quot;),ncol = 2), &quot;MRE.csv&quot;, na=&quot;&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Below, I&#39;m using `magrittr`&#39;s pipe operator `%&gt;%` merely for presentation, it is not required.)\r\n\r\nThe first example demonstrates `fread`&#39;s inference. The second shows our overriding that behavior, and now we have blank strings in each `NA` spot that is not the *literal string* `&quot;NA&quot;`.\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nfread(&quot;MRE.csv&quot;) %&gt;% str\r\n# Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t2 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n#  $ V1: int  1 2\r\n#  $ V1: int  0 NA\r\n#  $ V2: logi  NA NA\r\n#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; \r\n\r\nfread(&quot;MRE.csv&quot;, colClasses=&quot;character&quot;) %&gt;% str\r\n# Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t2 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot;\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;0&quot; &quot;&quot;\r\n#  $ V2: chr  &quot;&quot; &quot;NA&quot;\r\n#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can also be controlled on a per-column basis. One issue with this example is that `fread` is for some reason forcing the column of row-names to be named `V1`, the same as the next column. This looks like a bug to me, perhaps you can look at [Rdatatable&#39;s issues](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+V1) and potentially post a new one. (I might be wrong, perhaps this is intentional/known behavior.)\r\n\r\nBecause of this, per-column overriding seems to stop at the first occurrence of a column name.\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nfread(&quot;MRE.csv&quot;, colClasses=c(V1=&quot;character&quot;, V2=&quot;character&quot;)) %&gt;% str\r\n# Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t2 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot;\r\n#  $ V1: int  0 NA\r\n#  $ V2: chr  &quot;&quot; &quot;NA&quot;\r\n#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; \r\n```\r\n\r\nOne way around this is to go with an unnamed vector, requiring the same number of classes as the number of columns:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nfread(&quot;MRE.csv&quot;, colClasses=c(&quot;character&quot;,&quot;character&quot;,&quot;character&quot;)) %&gt;% str\r\n# Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t2 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot;\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;0&quot; &quot;&quot;\r\n#  $ V2: chr  &quot;&quot; &quot;NA&quot;\r\n#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother way (thanks @thelatemail) is with a list:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nfread(&quot;MRE.csv&quot;, colClasses=list(character=2:3)) %&gt;% str\r\n# Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;:\t2 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n#  $ V1: int  1 2\r\n#  $ V1: chr  &quot;0&quot; &quot;&quot;\r\n#  $ V2: chr  &quot;&quot; &quot;NA&quot;\r\n#  - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; \r\n```\r\n\r\nSide note: if you need to preserve them as ints/nums, then:\r\n\r\n1. if your concern is about how it affects follow-on calculations, then you can:\r\n    1. fix the source of the data so that nulls are not provided;\r\n    2. filter out the incomplete observations (rows); or\r\n    3. fix the calculations to deal intelligently with missing data.\r\n\r\n2. if your concern is about how it looks in a report, then whatever tool you are using to render in your report should have a mechanism for how to display `NA` values; for example, setting `options(knitr.kable.NA=&quot;&quot;)` before `knitr::kable(...)` will present them as empty strings.\r\n\r\n3. if your concern is about how it looks on your *console*, you have two options:\r\n    1. interfere with the data by iterating over each (intended) column and changing `NA` values to `&quot;&quot;`; this only works on `character` columns, and is irreversible; or\r\n    2. write your own subclass of `data.frame` that changes how it is displayed on the console; the benefit to this is that it is non-destructive; the problem is that you have to re-class each object where you want this behavior, and most (if not all) functions that output frames will likely inadvertently strip or omit that class from your input. (You&#39;ll need to write an S3 method of `print` for your subclass to do this.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210406/fread-importing-empty-as-na/58210616#58210616","title":"fread importing empty as NA"}],"owner":{"reputation":1322,"user_id":2011779,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/040b21236346b0d22ef032e63fc06a04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hedgedandlevered","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2011779/hedgedandlevered"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1322,"user_id":2011779,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/040b21236346b0d22ef032e63fc06a04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hedgedandlevered","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2011779/hedgedandlevered"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58210616,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570059853,"creation_date":1570057600,"last_edit_date":1570058296,"question_id":58210406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210406","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to import a csv with blanks read as `&quot;&quot;`.

Starting with iOS 13, the CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API will no longer return valid Wi-Fi SSID and BSSID information. Instead, the information returned by default will be: \r\n\r\nSSID: “Wi-Fi” or “WLAN” (“WLAN&quot; will be returned for the China SKU)\r\nBSSID: &quot;00:00:00:00:00:00&quot; \r\n\r\nIf your app is using this API, we encourage you to adopt alternative approaches that don’t require Wi-Fi or network information. Valid SSID and BSSID information from CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo will still be provided to VPN apps, apps that have used NEHotspotConfiguration to configure the current Wi-Fi network, and apps that have obtained permission to access user location through Location Services. \r\n\r\nTest your app on the latest iOS 13 beta to make sure it works properly. If your app requires valid Wi-Fi SSID and BSSID information to function, you can do the following:\r\nFor accessory setup apps, use the NEHotSpotConfiguration API, which now has the option to pass a prefix of the SSID hotspot your app expects to connect to.\r\nFor other types of apps, use the CoreLocation API to request the user’s consent to access location information.\r\n\r\nLearn more by reading the updated documentation or viewing the the Advances in Networking session video from WWDC19. You can also submit a TSI for code-level support. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nApple Developer Relations\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210359/ios-13-nehotspotconfigurationmanager-auto-join-wifi-issues-ssid-nil/58369383#58369383","title":"iOS 13 NEHotspotConfigurationManager Auto-Join Wifi issues SSID nil"}],"owner":{"reputation":150,"user_id":1395654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6VWb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jiebe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1395654/jiebe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571020109,"creation_date":1570057250,"question_id":58210359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210359","body_markdown":"As of iOS 13 when we request to join a WiFi network using the NEHotspotConfigurationManager, after a successful connection we may or may not be able to see the SSID using key kCNNetworkInfoKeySSID.\r\n\r\nOur app relies on seeing the SSID to set its state (if they are connected to our WiFi network show one version else show another).\r\n\r\nSo far we&#39;ve seen the issue on various devices (iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 11) using iOS 13.1.\r\n\r\nA device reboot fixes the problem.

In my test case, I am creating a user, and then again updating it. However, before updating, the cloud functions should have run and created a mapping used in the update security rule, but it doesn&#39;t seem to do this locally.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrules_version = &#39;2&#39;;\r\n\r\nservice cloud.firestore {\r\n\r\n  function userName() {\r\n    return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/uid_to_user_name/$(request.auth.uid))\r\n      .data\r\n      .userName;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\r\n    match /user/{userName} {\r\n      allow read: if signedIn();\r\n      allow create: if signedIn()\r\n        &amp;&amp; isValidUser(request.resource.data)\r\n        &amp;&amp; request.resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid\r\n        &amp;&amp; request.resource.data.name == userName;\r\n      allow update: if signedIn()\r\n        &amp;&amp; isValidUser(request.resource.data)\r\n        &amp;&amp; request.resource.data.name == resource.data.name\r\n        &amp;&amp; request.resource.data.name == userName\r\n        &amp;&amp; request.resource.data.name == userName();\r\n      allow delete: if false;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I have a cloud function that triggers onWrite for /user/{userName} which creates a uid-&gt;userName lookup in a table called uid_to_user_name. The problem is when I use `@firebase/testing` and run `firebase emulators:start --only firestore,functions`, it appears as though the two services don&#39;t fully interact. For instance, when I create a user, it passes my security rules, and I see also that the onWrite trigger has been activated. However, when I sleep for 5 seconds and attempt to update that user, the security rule fails because the mapping in `uid_to_username` is `undefined`. Curiously, well within that time, I also store and retrieve the value from `uid_to_username` from within the cloud function and it is present. So, it seems as though cloud firestore write operations trigger cloud functions, but writes done in the cloud functions don&#39;t update the firestore emulator. Is there some way to configure this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210353/google-cloud-functions-emulator-doesnt-interact-with-firebase-testing-locally","title":"Google Cloud Functions emulator doesn&#39;t interact with @firebase/testing locally"},{"tags":["php","laravel","email"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36653,"user_id":3583182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6JxNE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"patricus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3583182/patricus"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570063038,"post_id":58210405,"comment_id":102799229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210351/how-to-pass-a-collection-to-mailable-laravel/58210405#comment102799229_58210405"},{"owner":{"reputation":36653,"user_id":3583182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6JxNE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"patricus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3583182/patricus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570113072,"post_id":58210405,"comment_id":102818388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210351/how-to-pass-a-collection-to-mailable-laravel/58210405#comment102818388_58210405"},{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":11826875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5D_p1hUzu3E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/r8oKU_cWRIQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Wilson Guerrero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11826875/wilson-guerrero"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570124227,"post_id":58210405,"comment_id":102823647,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210351/how-to-pass-a-collection-to-mailable-laravel/58210405#comment102823647_58210405"},{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":11826875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5D_p1hUzu3E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/r8oKU_cWRIQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Wilson Guerrero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11826875/wilson-guerrero"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570125069,"post_id":58210405,"comment_id":102824024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210351/how-to-pass-a-collection-to-mailable-laravel/58210405#comment102824024_58210405"},{"owner":{"reputation":1200,"user_id":6091308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/414429816e418622bb1710bdfdac3eb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael Mano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6091308/michael-mano"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":36653,"user_id":3583182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6JxNE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"patricus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3583182/patricus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570148917,"post_id":58210405,"comment_id":102831648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210351/how-to-pass-a-collection-to-mailable-laravel/58210405#comment102831648_58210405"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1200,"user_id":6091308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/414429816e418622bb1710bdfdac3eb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael Mano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6091308/michael-mano"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1200,"user_id":6091308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/414429816e418622bb1710bdfdac3eb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael Mano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6091308/michael-mano"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570149104,"last_edit_date":1570149104,"creation_date":1570057595,"answer_id":58210405,"question_id":58210351,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210405","body_markdown":"EDIT:\r\n```\r\npublic $data;\r\npublic $pro;\r\n\r\npublic function __construct($data, $pro)\r\n{\r\n    $this-&gt;data = $data;\r\n    $this-&gt;pro = json_decode($pro, true);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\npublic function build()\r\n{\r\n    return $this-&gt;markdown(&#39;newpurch&#39;)-&gt;with([&#39;data&#39;

[The release notes in v4.3.0](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/b2e428d7c3f8661504c17ed936c3e79fd8b508dc/docs/source/release-notes.rst#430-2016-12-14-safety) regarding changes to locks explicitly comment on running multiple processes:\r\n\r\n&gt; [U]sers are cautioned that undefined behavior can result when conda is running in multiple process and operating on the same package caches and/or environments.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you&#39;re talking about different environments, so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue. However, you need to ensure that the package(s) to be installed is already downloaded into the package cache, otherwise it is not safe.\r\n\r\n## Partial Parallel Strategy\r\nThere is a `--download-only` flag, which will only add the package to the package cache (i.e., the part that cannot be done concurrently). But the issue is that this would still need to be done on a per-env basis, since different envs could have different constraints (e.g., different Python versions) that require different builds of the package.\r\n\r\nI think the best you could do at the CLI is\r\n\r\n1. Run `conda install --download-only pkg` sequentially on each env, then\r\n2. Run `conda install pkg` in parallel for the envs.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, not in any official recommendation, and changes in how Conda does transactions could lead to this not being safe.  I&#39;ll also say that I very much doubt this will save you much time; in fact, it might take longer. This approach will involve every env having to solve and prepare transactions twice, and that is usually the most computationally intensive step. The part you end up parallelizing involves disk transactions, which is going to be I/O bound, so I kind of doubt any time will be saved.\r\n\r\n## Some Evidence For This Being Safe\r\nWhile this doesn&#39;t positively prove its safety, we can explicitly examine the transactions to make sure that when we run Step 2 above, it will only involve LINK transactions.\r\n\r\nTo test this, I made two envs:\r\n\r\n    conda create -n foo -y python=3.6\r\n    conda create -n bar -y python=3.6\r\n\r\nThen I check the output from\r\n\r\n    conda install -n foo -d --json pandas\r\n\r\nwhich shows a list of both FETCH and LINK transactions. The former involve manipulating the package cache, whereas the latter only the env. If I then run \r\n\r\n    conda install -n foo --download-only pandas\r\n\r\nand check again,\r\n\r\n    conda install -n foo -d --json pandas\r\n\r\nI now see only LINK transactions.  Notably, the same is now true for `-n bar`, which should reinforce the fact that Step 1 should be done sequentially. The good part is that it won&#39;t lead to redownloading the same package; the bad part, that it involves a solve happening in every env. In a more heterogenous environment, we could expect there might be different FETCH operations in each env.\r\n\r\nFinally, I can run the parallel final install\r\n\r\n    conda install -n foo -y pandas &amp; conda install -n bar -y pandas &amp;\r\n\r\nwhich is safe if we can assume that that LINK transactions in different envs are safe.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210335/is-conda-install-a-thread-safe-operation/58228286#58228286","title":"Is conda install a thread-safe operation?"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":1278784,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b017a1b53609dde48dbb82bb3b16f08?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RedbackThomson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1278784/redbackthomson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":1278784,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b017a1b53609dde48dbb82bb3b16f08?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RedbackThomson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1278784/redbackthomson"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570147331,"creation_date":1570057104,"last_edit_date":1570064219,"question_id":58210335,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210335","body_markdown":"I would like to install packages into multiple conda environments.

So when I fetch data in view like I want to take course id but it&#39;s show instructor id because I join both table anyone can help please :)\r\nIf more information is required i will be Happy to explain.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210299/how-can-i-differ-two-tables-id-with-other-name-and-get-data-from-a-specific-tabl","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How can i differ two tables id with other name and get data from a specific table"},{"tags":["java","arrays","arraylist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35568,"user_id":3890632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNkgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khelwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890632/khelwood"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1570056685,"post_id":58210285,"comment_id":102798039,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210285/how-can-i-remove-an-arraylist-from-an-arraylist-of-arraylists#comment102798039_58210285"},{"owner":{"reputation":2118,"user_id":11374957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99c735e8edc586ff9ee67c666f413846?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kaan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11374957/kaan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570056825,"post_id":58210285,"comment_id":102798066,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210285/how-can-i-remove-an-arraylist-from-an-arraylist-of-arraylists#comment102798066_58210285"},{"owner":{"reputation":2386,"user_id":4934937,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQFIL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"maio290","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4934937/maio290"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570056853,"post_id":58210285,"comment_id":102798076,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210285/how-can-i-remove-an-arraylist-from-an-arraylist-of-arraylists#comment102798076_58210285"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97233,"user_id":3788176,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c18d321d8948803c05643d87b003dc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andy Turner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788176/andy-turner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570057093,"creation_date":1570057093,"answer_id":58210334,"question_id":58210285,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210334","body_markdown":"&gt; I tried to do something like this and got an error message says\r\n&gt; incompatible types\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     for(int f = 0; f&lt;longDistanceInput.size(); f ++){\r\n&gt;        ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt; newLongDisinput = longDistanceInput.remove(f);}\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s because `longDistanceInput.remove(f)` returns a `ArrayList&lt;String&gt;`, not a `ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String&gt;&gt;`.\r\n\r\nTry:\r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newLongDisinput = longDistanceInput.remove(f);\r\n\r\nHowever: be careful removing things while iterating forwards: you will end up removing only half the items in the list, because you skip over the one immediately after the one you remove.\r\n\r\nEither iterate in reverse; or just use `longDistanceInput.remove(0)` instead of `remove(f)`.

one thing you could do would be to set the user on the `api` guard, so when the auth middleware runs, it&#39;ll find the user you provided.

This is another reason why root relative urls are a good idea, the images are then independent of the location of the CSS file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#A_quick_primer_on_URLs_and_paths","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210266/datatables-sorting-arrows-not-appearing-getting-404-in-browser/58210481#58210481","title":"DataTable&#39;s sorting arrows not appearing (getting 404 in browser)"}],"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":10654347,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zclQg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bodrov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10654347/bodrov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3223,"user_id":1171702,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41d229f0cb9239e712ce687707b4c7f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wazz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1171702/wazz"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570064519,"creation_date":1570056458,"last_edit_date":1570064519,"question_id":58210266,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210266","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using DataTables on a C# project and the header&#39;s sorting arrows aren&#39;t appearing---in fact, in the console I&#39;m getting a `404` error.\r\n\r\nSo I created a local `/images` folder (which is what the default DataTables png url was pointing to) but the `404` error is still coming back.\r\n\r\nI tried tinkering around with the file paths under the `min.js` file but to no effect.
