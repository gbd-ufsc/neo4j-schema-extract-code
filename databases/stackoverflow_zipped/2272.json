Note _also_ that it takes the name of the file to read as the argument, instead of hardcoding some filename.\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n        Grade grading;\r\n\r\n        grading.readInput(&quot;grades.txt&quot;);\r\n        grading.print();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis would be the main program. \r\n\r\nThe simplified/extended version of `readGrades` could be:\r\n\r\n    void Grade::readInput(std::string fname) {\r\n        std::ifstream infile(fname);\r\n\r\n        infile.ignore(max_line_length, &#39;\\n&#39;); // ignore the first line\r\n\r\n        int grade = 0;\r\n\r\n        while (infile &gt;&gt; grade) {\r\n            grades.push_back(grade);\r\n            infile.ignore(max_line_length, &#39;\\n&#39;); // ignore rest eating newline\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote how we ignore lines or parts thereof that we are not interested in. For extra control consider disabling white-space skipping:\r\n\r\n     infile &gt;&gt; std::nowskipws;\r\n\r\nThe print function could be a simple:\r\n\r\n    void Grade::print(std::ostream&amp; os) const {\r\n        os &lt;&lt; &quot;Grades:&quot;;\r\n        for (int g : grades) {\r\n            os &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; g;\r\n        }\r\n        os &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Full Demo\r\n\r\n**&lt;kbd&gt;[Live On Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/3a59f798409caba8)&lt;/kbd&gt;**\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    struct Grade {\r\n        void readInput(std::string fname);\r\n    \r\n        void print(std::ostream&amp; os = std::cout) const;\r\n      private:\r\n        static constexpr auto max_line_length = std::numeric_limits&lt;ssize_t&gt;::max();\r\n        std::vector&lt;int&gt; grades;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        Grade grading;\r\n    \r\n        grading.readInput(&quot;grades.txt&quot;);\r\n        grading.print();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void Grade::readInput(std::string fname) {\r\n        std::ifstream infile(fname);\r\n    \r\n        infile.ignore(max_line_length, &#39;\\n&#39;); // ignore the first line\r\n    \r\n        int grade = 0;\r\n    \r\n        while (infile &gt;&gt; grade) {\r\n            grades.push_back(grade);\r\n            infile.ignore(max_line_length, &#39;\\n&#39;); // ignore rest eating newline\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void Grade::print(std::ostream&amp; os) const {\r\n        os &lt;&lt; &quot;Grades:&quot;;\r\n        for (int g : grades) {\r\n            os &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; g;\r\n        }\r\n        os &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPrints\r\n\r\n    Grades: 12 17 1 29\r\n\r\nGiven `grades.txt`:\r\n\r\n    Ignore the first line\r\n    12\r\n    17\r\n    1\r\n    29\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999769/how-to-read-the-2nd-3rd-and-4th-line-of-a-text-file-c/57999972#57999972","title":"How to read the 2nd, 3rd and 4th line of a text file.

My current code is as follows\r\n```r\r\ndframe &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(file(&quot;filename&quot;))\r\n\r\n#[[2]][[x]] is location of s_id and [[15]][[x]] is location of m_s_name lists\r\nm_to_frame = function(dframe){\r\n  s_ids= c()\r\n  for(x in (1:length(dframe$s_id))){\r\n     s_ids = c(s_ids,rep(dframe[[2]][[x]],length(dframe[[15]][[x]])))\r\n  }\r\n  msc = purrr::flatten(dframe$m_s_name)\r\n  return(tibble(s_id=s_ids,m_s_name=msc))\r\n}\r\nm = m_to_frame(dframe)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JSON is formatted as follows \r\n```json\r\n[{&quot;u_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;s_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;s_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;display_text_width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;reply_to_s_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;reply_to_u_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;reply_to_s_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,\r\n    &quot;is_q&quot;:false,\r\n    &quot;is_r&quot;:false,\r\n    &quot;fav_count&quot;:15,\r\n    &quot;r_count&quot;:1,\r\n    &quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;],\r\n    &quot;m_s_name&quot;:[&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;]\r\n}]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999710/faster-way-to-split-json-objects-into-multiple-data-frames","title":"Faster way to split JSON objects into multiple data frames?"},{"tags":["c#","xamarin","xamarin.forms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57156,"user_id":1338,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8170deb73d6e2169e227aa588a0b32b8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1338/jason"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568835898,"post_id":57999703,"comment_id":102405438,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999703/trying-to-change-a-label-from-two-enteries-when-button-pressed-and-display-on-an#comment102405438_57999703"},{"owner":{"reputation":3096,"user_id":8977696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/682bbe620246aa30672afa1217a43800?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arvind Chourasiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8977696/arvind-chourasiya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568870111,"post_id":57999703,"comment_id":102413095,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999703/trying-to-change-a-label-from-two-enteries-when-button-pressed-and-display-on-an#comment102413095_57999703"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12086955,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDfDYQhLK0HJN4czKASAQ8YtXhkIT_T0V2QrAQ7eA=k-s128","display_name":"navreet sidhu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086955/navreet-sidhu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568945065,"post_id":58004684,"comment_id":102444910,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999703/trying-to-change-a-label-from-two-enteries-when-button-pressed-and-display-on-an/58004684#comment102444910_58004684"},{"owner":{"reputation":2886,"user_id":10504796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPxgw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Junior Jiang -

I have discovered that I must use [LightningProviders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/lightningproviders) to accomplish this . So I tried to follow this guide to use lightning providers properly. \r\n\r\nI used very simple code:\r\n```\r\n            if (LightningProvider.IsLightningEnabled)\r\n            {\r\n                LowLevelDevicesController.DefaultProvider = LightningProvider.GetAggregateProvider();\r\n            }\r\n            GpioStatus = &quot;Initializing...&quot;;\r\n            var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault();\r\n            if (gpio == null)\r\n            {\r\n                GpioStatus = &quot;There is no GPIO controller on this device.&quot;;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                gpio.OpenPin(1).Write(GpioPinValue.High);\r\n                GpioStatus = gpio.OpenPin(1).Read().ToString();\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nWhere GpioStatus is output text on a UI.\r\n\r\nI discovered that if I run the ``                LowLevelDevicesController.DefaultProvider = LightningProvider.GetAggregateProvider();`` line outside of the enabled check, it picks up the GPIO controller and lets me detect how many pins I have and read them (All low). However I can&#39;t change the DriveMode or write to the pins without error. The error I get just says to ``Make sure the LightningProviders are enabled``.\r\n\r\nThis brings me back to the guide I linked at the start. It suggests to enable DMAP drivers using the Device Portal for W10IoT or DMAPUtil.exe. I have tried both. In the Device Portal the area where it should be is just blank. And in the command line trying to use the DMAPUtil.exe only returns that ``dmaputil.exe is not available on this system``.\r\n\r\nTherefore I am asking if there is any other way to enable the LightningProviders or if there a way to know if they are incompatible with my board?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nAlso tried using the devcon.exe commands in the W10IoT Command line.\r\nI am able to locate the Direct memory access controller but when i do ``devcon.exe enable *PNP0200`` it says it is enabled but remains disabled when checked with ``devcon.exe status *PNP0200``","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999700/how-to-enable-lightningproviders-for-gpio","title":"How to enable LightningProviders for GPIO?"},{"tags":["julia"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2030,"user_id":4092216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nnp7O.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cameron Bieganek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4092216/cameron-bieganek"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568839005,"post_id":58000113,"comment_id":102406604,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999697/error-syntax-cannot-juxtapose-string-literal-when-ending-a-triple-quoted-str/58000113#comment102406604_58000113"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21870,"user_id":659248,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/21aeae1f260365557523718bc19640f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"StefanKarpinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/659248/stefankarpinski"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21870,"user_id":659248,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/21aeae1f260365557523718bc19640f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"StefanKarpinski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/659248/stefankarpinski"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1568954095,"last_edit_date":1568954095,"creation_date":1568837515,"answer_id":58000113,"question_id":57999697,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000113","body_markdown":"The issue is that this by itself is a valid string literal:\r\n\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;\r\n    &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen you follow that with another `&quot;` the parser thinks &quot;woah, you can’t just follow a string with another string&quot;.

I was thinking in order reach my goal I would have to just set a counter and write it to a file and pull that counter when I am making a new entry, just wondering if anyone know something else I can do instead of reading/writing a file for one number.\r\n\r\nShould be noted this is on a server that can be shutdown and restarted, the user must enter in the information that goes into the database and the server will log it for the user. And I don&#39;t want to every repeat the same entry number.\r\n\r\nI have mainly used PHP, HTML, and Python for the current project I am working on.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999685/sqlite3-is-there-anyway-to-know-the-amount-of-entries-that-have-been-added","title":"SQlite3 is there anyway to know the amount of entries that have been added?"},{"tags":["amcharts4"],"owner":{"reputation":274,"user_id":6073028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a273fdf1094d5ea5904dcdb5dcc5de33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CodeMonkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6073028/codemonkey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568835212,"creation_date":1568835212,"question_id":57999676,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999676","body_markdown":"Is there any way to get a clustered column chart (or any chart for that matter but column as an example) without defining multiple series in your data set?\r\n\r\nAll the examples I&#39;ve found so far, they show the data source as being something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  americas: 50,\r\n  japan: 25,\r\n  europe: 30,\r\n  date: &#39;2015-01-01&#39;\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis structure basically pivots the &#39;region&#39; dimension so that each of its values become a field. But what I&#39;d like to do is use a data set structured more like:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  region: &#39;americas&#39;,\r\n  revenue: 50,\r\n  date: &#39;2015-01-01&#39;\r\n},\r\n{\r\n  region: &#39;japan&#39;,\r\n  revenue: 25,\r\n  date: &#39;2015-01-01&#39;\r\n},\r\n{\r\n  region &#39;europe&#39;,\r\n  revenue: 30,\r\n  date: &#39;2015-01-01&#39;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is more in line with the way the database returns the data.  Two dimensions (region &amp; date), and one measure (revenue).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve worked with other charting libraries before, such as Kendo UI, and it has an option to generate groupings based on dimension values.

Isn&#39;t JAXB not part of standard JDK and take care of marshalling and unmarshalling out of the box instead on relying on other jar files?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999649/spring-boot-rest-does-not-support-xml-out-of-the-box","title":"spring boot rest does not support xml out of the box"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","class","operator-overloading"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1568835221,"post_id":57999648,"comment_id":102405174,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999648/why-i-cant-fetch-an-attribute-inside-objects-setattr-method#comment102405174_57999648"},{"owner":{"reputation":47665,"user_id":1453822,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c8db97d2ecdfe5e044cee4c470abb60?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DeepSpace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1453822/deepspace"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835288,"post_id":57999648,"comment_id":102405203,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999648/why-i-cant-fetch-an-attribute-inside-objects-setattr-method#comment102405203_57999648"},{"owner":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":47665,"user_id":1453822,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c8db97d2ecdfe5e044cee4c470abb60?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"DeepSpace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1453822/deepspace"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568836173,"post_id":57999648,"comment_id":102405542,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999648/why-i-cant-fetch-an-attribute-inside-objects-setattr-method#comment102405542_57999648"},{"owner":{"reputation":2977,"user_id":2378643,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mt7f4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anon Coward","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2378643/anon-coward"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6925,"user_id":8475054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbf41c4b5aecb1a949936e06368a7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Robin Zigmond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8475054/robin-zigmond"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568836317,"post_id":57999648,"comment_id":102405601,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999648/why-i-cant-fetch-an-attribute-inside-objects-setattr-method#comment102405601_57999648"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2977,"user_id":2378643,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mt7f4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anon Coward","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2378643/anon-coward"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568835528,"creation_date":1568835528,"answer_id":57999733,"question_id":57999648,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999733","body_markdown":"The full error message is informative:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;example_code.py&quot;, line 11, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    myObj = MyClass(1)\r\n  File &quot;example_code.py&quot;, line 3, in __init__\r\n    self.x = x\r\n  File &quot;example_code.py&quot;, line 6, in __setattr__\r\n    print(self.x)  # doesn&#39;t work\r\nAttributeError: &#39;MyClass&#39; object has no attribute &#39;x&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re seeing an error on the initialization of `MyClass`, which in turn calls `self.x = x`, which in turn is calling into your custom `__setattr__` implementation to do the work.

console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .container div:not([class]) {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      background: blue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .container div.child {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        jkfhakfhkadshfksdhfasdk\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n          child\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n          dhild\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n          djalfjasdl;fjasl;fjas;lfj\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: If you only want to go two levels deep (meaning classes `divs` won&#39;t be affected within the second level div), you can do this:\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n    \r\n      &gt; div:not([class]) {\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n    \r\n        &gt; div:not([class]) {\r\n          height: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere it is in action with the second level selector:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      height:

.container&gt;div:not([class])&gt;div:not([class]) {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        top level no class\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n          first child with class\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n          first child with class\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n          second child no class\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n            third child with class\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n              fourth child no class no affected by red bg\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n

   events = selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE\r\n    ...\r\n    sel.register(connected_sock, events, data=data)\r\n\r\nThis makes select trigger whenever the socket is writable - no matter if you actually have something to write in `data.outb` or not. Which means it will trigger always as long the socket is not closed yet.\r\n\r\n    ls.connect((HOST, PORT))\r\n    ls.send(b&#39;Hi world&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis will connect to the server. The connection will be done inside the OS kernel and will ultimately result in triggering the server socket in your program which then calls `accept`. But `connect` actually returns in the client after the connection is established in the servers kernel, which might be before `accept` was called. The `send` thus will provide the newly created socket already with data.\r\n\r\n\r\n    def service_connection(key, event):\r\n        ...\r\n        if event &amp; selectors.EVENT_READ:\r\n            ...\r\n        elif event &amp; selectors.EVENT_WRITE:\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nYour server handles only a single condition at the socket, even if the socket is both readable and writeable. It is always writable as explained above but you run into the readable first since the data from the client are already in the socket buffer at the server side once you&#39;ve finished `accept`. Thus, the first `EVENT_WRITE` will only be handled once there are already data in `data.outb` from the previous `EVENT_READ`.\r\n\r\n            sent = connected_sock.send(data.outb)\r\n            data.outb = data.outb[sent:]\r\n            print(&#39;ANYTHING&#39;) # removing this changes socket behaviour\r\n\r\nThis send the data to the client and then adds some delay to the server since printing to the terminal actually takes some time. If this delay is not there (i.e. no `print`) then the selector will immediately be called again (since `EVENT_WRITE` always triggers, see above) and your code will stumble over the empty `data.outb`.\r\n\r\nIf this delay is there though then the socket will be closed (and thus no more `EVENT_WRITE` triggered) since the client closes the connection immediately after it received the data:\r\n\r\n    ls.recv(1024)\r\n    ls.close()\r\n\r\nNote that this only behaves this way since you are using client and server on the same machine. If these would be on different machines then network latency would add enough timing differences by their own so you might see a different but maybe similar confusing behavior.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to handle this situation is of course to enable `EVENT_WRITE` only if you actually have data in `data.outb` and disable it immediately if all data are sent.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999637/why-is-socket-behaviour-dependant-on-a-print-statement/57999971#57999971","title":"Why is socket behaviour dependant on a print statement?"}],"owner":{"reputation":388,"user_id":8456253,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/488d3a9f1863fb3afacbedecd42c25d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kuco 23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8456253/kuco-23"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57999971,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568837165,"creation_date":1568834995,"question_id":57999637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999637","body_markdown":"I do not understand how something like a print statement can affect socket behaviour.

In a nutshell the solution is to use [ray-cast][2] in the direction of the movement and see if there is a collision.\r\n\r\nWhat I did was create a tilemap and call all the tiles that allow player movement &#39;walkable_[something]&#39;. In the player script where I detect the collision from the ray cast I check the name of the tile the raycast collided with. If the name begins with &#39;walkable&#39; I allow movement and in all other cases I don&#39;t.\r\n\r\n```\r\nonready var ray = $RayCast2D\r\n\r\nvar speed = 256 # big number because it&#39;s multiplied by delta\r\nvar tile_size = 64 # size in pixels of tiles on the grid\r\n\r\nvar last_position = Vector2() # last idle position\r\nvar target_position = Vector2() # desired position to move towards\r\nvar movedir = Vector2() # move direction\r\n\r\nfunc _process(delta):\r\n\t# MOVEMENT\r\n\tif ray.is_colliding():\r\n\t\tvar collision = ray.get_collider()\r\n\t\tif collision is TileMap:\r\n\t\t\tvar tile_name = get_tile(collision)\t\t\r\n\t\t\tif !(tile_name.begins_with(&quot;Walkable&quot;)):\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tposition = last_position\r\n\t\t\t\ttarget_position = last_position\r\n\t\t\telse:\r\n\t\t\t\tposition += speed * movedir * delta\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif position.distance_to(last_position) &gt;= tile_size - speed * delta: # if we&#39;ve moved further than one space\r\n\t\t\t\t\tposition = target_position # snap the player to the intended position\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\telse:\r\n\t\tposition += speed * movedir * delta\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tif position.distance_to(last_position) &gt;= tile_size - speed * delta: # if we&#39;ve moved further than one space\r\n\t\t\tposition = target_position # snap the player to the intended position\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the get_tile() function, it gets the string name of the tile the ray cast collided with. Because the raycast collision returns the **whole** tile map we need to know which specific tile we collided with. So I used the position of the player + the direction of the ray cast vector to figure out the correct tile. First I added half a tile in width and height of a tile size because the player position is considered the top left corner of the player node. For example if the player is a square of size 2x2 and he&#39;s positioned on (0,0). It means it&#39;s top left corner is on 0,0. Which means that 1,1 is the center of the square. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc get_tile(tile_map):\t\r\n\tif tile_map is TileMap:\r\n\t\tvar v = Vector2(tile_size / 2 , tile_size /2)\r\n\t\tvar tile_pos = tile_map.world_to_map(position + v + ray.cast_to)\r\n\t\tvar tile_id = tile_map.get_cellv(tile_pos)\r\n\t\tif (tile_id == -1):\r\n\t\t\treturn &quot;None&quot;\r\n\t\telse:\r\n\t\t\treturn tile_map.tile_set.tile_get_name(tile_id)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completion [here][3] is a pastebin of the full player script.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://fornclake.com/2019/03/grid\r\n  [2]: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/physics/ray-casting.html\r\n  [3]: https://pastebin.com/kimj4g0x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999635/godot-how-to-limit-player-movement-to-certain-tiles-only/58015793#58015793","title":"Godot: How to limit player movement to certain tiles only?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12086921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/845f3f66d0d5dbf9864cbb25a742bb6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PragmaticSystematic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086921/pragmaticsystematic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568912366,"creation_date":1568834987,"question_id":57999635,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999635","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make a &#39;[Stone Age][1]&#39; clone.\r\nAnd I&#39;m trying to figure a way to limit my player movement to certain tiles.

In @Pearly’s answer the frequencies are guaranteed equal, given that 50 is a multiple of 5, and randomness is manifest only in the order in which they arrive. This answer is like tossing a die with five faces 50 times; @Pearly’s answer is like drawing from a deck of 50 cards with 5 distinct types.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999619/random-lottery-numbers-from-macro-to-variable/57999843#57999843","title":"Random lottery numbers from macro to variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12086936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eda046ef282e221e191fb05687c017f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hannah mills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086936/hannah-mills"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18464,"user_id":8682794,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bn9Zv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pearly Spencer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8682794/pearly-spencer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57999843,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568884489,"creation_date":1568834948,"last_edit_date":1568835082,"question_id":57999619,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999619","body_markdown":"I have the following lottery numbers in a macro:\r\n\r\n    global lottery 6 9 4 32 98\r\n\r\nHow can I simulate a variable with `50` observations, where each observation is randomly obtained from the numbers stored in the macro?\r\n\r\nThe code below produces an error:\r\n\r\n    set obs 50\r\n    global lottery 6 9 4 32 98\r\n    \r\n    g lot=$lottery\r\n    invalid &#39;9&#39; \r\n    r(198);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999619/random-lottery-numbers-from-macro-to-variable","title":"Random lottery numbers from macro to variable"},{"tags":["android","html","youtube"],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":5821265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1087917057915175/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pavel Kaleta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5821265/pavel-kaleta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568834933,"creation_date":1568834933,"question_id":57999612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999612","body_markdown":"I made a website with YouTube video embedded using official &lt;iframe&gt; tag generated on YouTube video page.

My iPhone doesn&#39;t do that so I was really surprised when he told me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999612/android-opens-youtube-app-when-visiting-website-with-embedded-video","title":"Android opens YouTube app when visiting website with embedded video"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":161240,"user_id":14104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otetW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"epascarello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835089,"post_id":57999610,"comment_id":102405124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999610/jquery-toggle-elements-based-on-data-attribute-with-the-same-class#comment102405124_57999610"},{"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":9738446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"express_v2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9738446/express-v2"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":161240,"user_id":14104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otetW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"epascarello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835113,"post_id":57999610,"comment_id":102405132,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999610/jquery-toggle-elements-based-on-data-attribute-with-the-same-class#comment102405132_57999610"},{"owner":{"reputation":391,"user_id":11854340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7NKwSxfvSVc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAQ0A/5XZ8pPC_ZP0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eisenheim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11854340/eisenheim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835767,"post_id":57999610,"comment_id":102405382,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999610/jquery-toggle-elements-based-on-data-attribute-with-the-same-class#comment102405382_57999610"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":9738446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"express_v2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9738446/express-v2"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835288,"post_id":57999669,"comment_id":102405202,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999610/jquery-toggle-elements-based-on-data-attribute-with-the-same-class/57999669#comment102405202_57999669"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":161240,"user_id":14104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otetW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"epascarello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello"},"last_editor":{"reputation":161240,"user_id":14104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/otetW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"epascarello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568836777,"last_edit_date":1568836777,"creation_date":1568835177,"answer_id":57999669,"question_id":57999610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999669","body_markdown":"Hide them all and show the one that was picked\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;.instructor-button&#39;).click(function() {\r\n\r\n      // check if button is active\r\n      var button = $(this).toggleClass(&quot;active&quot;);\r\n      var isActive = button.is(&quot;.active&quot;)\r\n\r\n      //remove any other button that may have been active\r\n      $(&#39;.instructor-button&#39;).not(button).removeClass(&quot;active&quot;)\r\n      \r\n      // get what was clicked\r\n      var instructor = button.data(&quot;toggles&quot;)\r\n      \r\n      // get all the reviews\r\n      var reviews = $(&#39;.review[data-instructor]&#39;)\r\n      // get the reviews that were clicked\r\n      var current = reviews.filter(&#39;[data-instructor=&quot;&#39;

Any ideas to why this might be?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my page, I have a bunch of buttons which correspond to an instructor. And I have reviews, which contain an instructor. By default, all reviews are shown. When one of the buttons is clicked, I want to show only the reviews for that instructor. And when it is clicked off, I want to show all the reviews again, or if another instructor button was pressed, I want to show the reviews for that.\r\n\r\nHTML for Instructor Buttons\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &lt;button class=&quot;ui basic small button instructor-button&quot; id=&quot;Instructor A&quot;&gt;\r\n    Instructor A\r\n  &lt;/button&gt;\r\n  \r\n  &lt;button class=&quot;ui basic small button instructor-button&quot; id=&quot;Instructor B&quot;&gt;\r\n    Instructor B\r\n  &lt;/button&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML for Reviews\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;reviews&quot;&gt;\r\n   &lt;div class=&quot;review&quot; data-instructor=&quot;Instructor A&quot;&gt;\r\n    // elements for review\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;review&quot; data-instructor=&quot;Instructor B&quot;&gt;\r\n    // elements for review\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the JQuery that I&#39;ve attempted\r\n```\r\n$(&#39;.instructor-button&#39;).click(function() {\r\n      var instructor = this.id;\r\n      $(&#39;.review[data-instructor!=&quot;&#39; + instructor + &#39;&quot;]&#39;).toggle()\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works but only when the first review is the one I selected, otherwise it hides all the reviews. Any idea on how to go about doing this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999610/jquery-toggle-elements-based-on-data-attribute-with-the-same-class","title":"JQuery - Toggle Elements based on data attribute with the same class"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11059383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BnaRZmDvQvk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQPTsCJh3wGQh4nJ8W7PdzDuun6-TQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Max Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11059383/max-paul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568835146,"post_id":57999659,"comment_id":102405147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999607/error-using-pop-function-to-take-user-input-to-replace-a-certain-point-in-the/57999659#comment102405147_57999659"},{"owner":{"reputation":1414,"user_id":3308951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUOnA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SyntaxVoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3308951/syntaxvoid"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11059383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BnaRZmDvQvk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQPTsCJh3wGQh4nJ8W7PdzDuun6-TQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Max Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11059383/max-paul"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568837801,"post_id":57999659,"comment_id":102406147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999607/error-using-pop-function-to-take-user-input-to-replace-a-certain-point-in-the/57999659#comment102406147_57999659"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1422,"user_id":9028015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CsPp0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mason Caiby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9028015/mason-caiby"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1422,"user_id":9028015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CsPp0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mason Caiby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9028015/mason-caiby"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568835169,"last_edit_date":1568835169,"creation_date":1568835108,"answer_id":57999659,"question_id":57999607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999659","body_markdown":"    x = input(&#39;Which part of the list would you like to remove?(index starts at 0):&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    myThing.pop(int(x))\r\n    print(myThing)\r\n\r\npop takes the index you want to remove as an argument, so you pass it in the parenthesis following the `.pop`.

is too long for a comment, and well, it&#39;s a kind of answer at that, too :-)\r\n\r\nWriting a query starts with a precise idea of what to select. To me it looks like you are trying to write the query before you have the rules straight.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say it&#39;s not 30, but 2 top / bottom occurrences, not 30 but 2 males / females you want to select. This lets us create sample data that we can work with:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nname    sex   occurrences\r\nAlbert  M     6\r\nAlfred  M     6\r\nBill    M     6\r\nJack    M     6\r\nJane    F     5\r\nJill    F     5\r\nMary    F     5\r\nRobert  M     2\r\nSam     M     2\r\nTom     M     2\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nYou see there can be a lot of ties. The top / bottom 2 occurrences? Well there are 4 top, 3 bottom and they don&#39;t even include any female. Or did you mean the top / bottom 2 per sex? Then we&#39;d have 4 top males and 3 bottom males. And three top females who are also the three bottom females.\r\n\r\nOf all these rows, which would you consider to show? Would you have any preferences applied?\r\n\r\nGet the algorithm first. Then write the query.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999588/sql-limits-within-columns/58000079#58000079","title":"SQL Limits Within Columns"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11985587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wjUAjvCzt88/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdM8MscVbXVyefus6n7MxuWwx2f7g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mircea Sauciuc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11985587/mircea-sauciuc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57999622,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568837396,"creation_date":1568834840,"question_id":57999588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999588","body_markdown":"I&#39;m a noob to SQL and am currently using SQLite and have come across an issue I cannot seem to resolve or find an answer to (my deep sense is that I&#39;m not asking it correctly via Google). Extremely rudimentary for most here, so my apologies -- but also a huge &#39;Thank You&#39; -- in advance. Here&#39;s the issue.\r\n\r\nI have a social security names file which I would like to parse based on name, gender, and the top/bottom 30 occurrences. When I do the code below, it just spits back the alphabetical order to the first 30 males names with 6 occurrences. The same for when I run females. \r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM names_1899\r\n    WHERE Occurrences BETWEEN &#39;5&#39; AND &#39;6&#39;\r\n    AND Sex = &#39;M&#39; OR &#39;F&#39;\r\n    LIMIT 30\r\n\r\nwhich spits out something great, but not what I&#39;m not looking for (not the complete list of 30 to save space):\r\n\r\n    Alberto\tM\t6\r\n    Alcide\tM\t6\r\n    Alferd\tM\t6\r\n    Almer\tM\t6\r\n    Alpha\tM\t6\r\n    Alto\tM\t6\r\n    Andres\tM\t6\r\n    Armond\tM\t6\r\n    Armstead\tM\t6\r\n    Arvil\tM\t6\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like it to produce a list like above with 30 males and 30 females, both either from the top/bottom 30 occurrences.\r\n\r\nIf I add a GROUP BY and ORDER BY, it also is meaningless to me:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM names_1899\r\n    WHERE Occurrences BETWEEN &#39;5&#39; AND &#39;6&#39;\r\n    AND Sex = &#39;M&#39; OR &#39;F&#39;\r\n    GROUP BY Sex\r\n    ORDER BY Occurences ASC\r\n    LIMIT 30\r\n\r\nsimply producing just the top male name:\r\n\r\n    Alberto\tM\t6\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you, in advance, to anyone who can help me on this terribly simple problem. Your time is certainly appreciated.

It will show and hide tomostSubform.test1 by selecting the radio button, but not together with the checkbox. \r\n\r\n    if ( topmostSubform.Page1.Section3.PlantLocation.PL1.rawValue ==1 &amp;&amp; topmostSubform.Page1.Section3.RadioButtonList.rawValue == 1 ) {\r\n     topmostSubform.test1.presence =&quot;visible&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    else {\r\n     topmostSubform.test1.presence =&quot;hidden&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not a programmer so it will be much appreciated if anyone could provide any examples with explanations.

like many git host propose you a way to do it : The fork. The point is to start a new git starting as a copy of the first one. Bonus : you will be able to merge what you done on the new git to the source one with a merge request. You will be able to do it by creating a new git repository and set the git you want to fork as a upstream.\r\n\r\nThe other way is to clone the git you want on your local machine, then push it to a new one. It is closer to a copy because in this case the two git repositories (old one and the copy) will be fully independents.

However, I would recommend not manipulating your query&#39;s formula in VBA (as you can&#39;t be sure the result is syntactically valid in M).\r\n\r\nBased on your VBA code, your query is in the same workbook as the ranges/cells being used to make the query&#39;s formula &quot;dynamic&quot;. If you turn those ranges/cells (e.g. cell `A1`) into named ranges, you can then use `Excel.CurrentWorkbook` in Power Query to read the values in those named ranges.\r\n\r\nThis means you don&#39;t need to push those cells&#39; values to Power Query. Instead, Power Query can read them for itself -- and your query is still &quot;dynamic&quot;.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nMinor detail.

Ideally there would be a differential operator `D` so that say `D(f)(x)` would be the same as `f(x).diff(x)`. With that you could represent this as `D(f)(2*y)` which could of course display as `f&#39;(2y)`.\r\n\r\nOf course if you substitute a function for `f` here then the derivative can evaluate:\r\n```\r\nIn [45]: f(x).diff(x).subs(x, 2*y).subs(f, Lambda(t, t**3))                                                                       \r\nOut[45]: \r\n⎛d ⎛ 3⎞⎞│     \r\n⎜──⎝x ⎠⎟│     \r\n⎝dx    ⎠│x=2⋅y\r\n\r\nIn [46]: _.doit()                                                                                                                 \r\nOut[46]: \r\n    2\r\n12⋅y \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo answer your other question, clearly you can&#39;t multiply a 9x9 matrix and a 3x3 matrix. Your equation for `F` implies that both `H` and `M` are square and of the same size. Either your mass matrix is really just 3x3 or your potential function is really a function of 9 coordinates. Assuming `r1` is the distance between say atom 1 and atom 2 then maybe `r1 = sqrt((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2 + (z1 - z2)**2)` in which case you should compute your Hessian wrt `x1` etc rather than `r1`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999542/sympy-solve-entries-in-hessian-matrix-for-better-readability/58000225#58000225","title":"Sympy: Solve entries in Hessian Matrix for better readability?"}],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":10430394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/617c4a391a2d6429bcad808d3fe18e72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10430394/j-doe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58000225,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568838048,"creation_date":1568834570,"question_id":57999542,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999542","body_markdown":"I&#39;m very green when it comes to ```sympy``` and I don&#39;t know how to produce output in a well formatted fashion.

One of then is about how to deal with Lambda Retry Behavior and how to control and prevent errors.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we put all code logic into try/catch with a generic catch logic that just writes a simple error log or something that does not truly deal with the error. In most cases, we do it simply because we don&#39;t want a retry execution. \r\ni.e. a scheduled lambda that puts some things in a SQS queue and another lambda that consumes it. In a recent past, we just wrapped all logic of the second lambda into a generic try/catch to not have a retry, since the first lambda will put it again in the SQS queue. \r\n\r\nBut when I started to monitor errors statistics with CloudWatch metrics I saw the problem: many errors were not detected by the metrics simply because this use of try/catch.\r\n\r\nI have a timebox to learn how it works and how to deal with it in a correct manner, but I have to be sure about my knowledge to be assertive refactoring it. After hours of research I&#39;ve come to some conclusions but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m correct:\r\n\r\n1)I have a CloudWatch Errors Dashboard that shows me statistics across all lambdas (about 50). Try/Catch will make these errors invisible to the statistics? The only way to show those errors in my error statistic metrics is not to put it into any try/catch or throwing the exception to the caller method? Or any other way that result in a exception coming to my lambda entry-point method will suffice?\r\n\r\n2)So, all of those generics try/catches are a bad smell and I have to deal with the retry behavior in a correct way considering the retry police? Even if the method is sync or async, if lambda are invoked by API Gateway, SQS, SNS,  etc?\r\ni.e. instead of wrapping my lambda that reads a SQS in a try/catch to evict a retry, I have to configure a SQS Redrive Policy to never retry. Or allow a retry and prepare my code to deal with it (checking if the operations has executed previously, to evict duplicate processing because when one message in the chunk fails, all my chunk will be retried).\r\n\r\n3) I have basically 4 event sources that invokes a lambda: API Gateway, SQS, SNS and scheduled events (by CloudWatch). Basically when lambda is invoked by:\r\n-The API Gateway: It never retries except if the invoke decides to retry when my service return an error, cause they are sync and sync lambdas invocations, by default, do not retry.\r\n-The SNS and scheduled CloudWatch events: It will retry twice cause they are an async invocation.\r\n-The SQS: Has configurable retry policy.\r\n\r\nAm I in a correct path to start a review and refactor my lambdas to be less error prone and more monitorable?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999532/how-to-deal-with-lambda-retry-behavior-in-a-correct-way","title":"How to deal with lambda retry behavior in a correct way"},{"tags":["database","database-design","entity-relationship"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12539,"user_id":3404097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e38747633941acae3957fd99b5ebe20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"philipxy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3404097/philipxy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568873357,"post_id":57999528,"comment_id":102414221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999528/designing-an-er-diagram-for-hockey-league-database#comment102414221_57999528"},{"owner":{"reputation":12539,"user_id":3404097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e38747633941acae3957fd99b5ebe20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"philipxy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3404097/philipxy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568875128,"post_id":57999528,"comment_id":102414985,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999528/designing-an-er-diagram-for-hockey-league-database#comment102414985_57999528"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12539,"user_id":3404097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e38747633941acae3957fd99b5ebe20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"philipxy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3404097/philipxy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12539,"user_id":3404097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e38747633941acae3957fd99b5ebe20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"philipxy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3404097/philipxy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569185906,"last_edit_date":1569185906,"creation_date":1568874553,"answer_id":58004929,"question_id":57999528,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58004929","body_markdown":"Play is a relation(ship)/association type whose relationship instances relate/associate 3 participant entity instances--a Game &amp; 2 Teams.

Your diagram wrongly has just one participation/line to Team.\r\n\r\nA number, range or other cardinality annotation on a line says something (depending on your method) about permitted/valid combinations of entity instance/subrow participations over multiple relationship instances/rows of a relationship type/table. It doesn&#39;t address the number of participations by one entity type in each relationship instance, which is what a line documents.\r\n\r\nThere are typically multiple reasonable ways to precisely/formally define an informal specification. So a &quot;solution&quot; different from yours wouldn&#39;t make yours wrong.

A game is played between two teams such as host-team and guest team and has a date and a score. \r\n\r\n**Assumptions I made**\r\n\r\n1. Game is a weak entity because `date, host, guest` together uniquely identify a row in Game table.\r\n2. Many games can be played in a single day. But two teams can play only one match in a day.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, my ER diagram is as \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere `2...2` means group of two participations at a time.\r\n*The direction of arrow is in the direction of many to one relationship*.\r\n\r\n(This notation may be wrong, as I concluded it from some already solved problems in the net...In case of football matches, each match should have atleast 3 referees) **Please correct me if I am wrong**.\r\n\r\nBut the solution is given as \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nWhere they have used a self relationship.\r\n\r\nI doubt that my second assumption(and a very valid one) doesn&#39;t hold here. \r\n\r\nMy question is that keeping in mind the above assumptions, whether my designing is correct or not? If not what are the mistakes here?\r\n\r\n**If I am wrong then please point it out. A possible way to rectify the mistake would really help.**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/30MWt.jpg\r\n  [2]:

Or it just against the spirit of Restful API?\r\n\r\nI want the output JSON be like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n{*para object},\r\n{*para object},\r\n[{*para object},{*para object}],\r\n{*para object}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999503/django-rest-framework-nested-list-serialization","title":"Django Rest Framework nested list serialization"},{"tags":["python","web-scraping","beautifulsoup"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":8942728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cccb12a4392c3713855914bc8815673?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8942728/ryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568838202,"post_id":58000100,"comment_id":102406309,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999502/scraping-table-from-state-of-texas-query-tool/58000100#comment102406309_58000100"},{"owner":{"reputation":838,"user_id":11596424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIFWH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LuckyZakary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11596424/luckyzakary"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9,"user_id":8942728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cccb12a4392c3713855914bc8815673?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8942728/ryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568839111,"post_id":58000100,"comment_id":102406634,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999502/scraping-table-from-state-of-texas-query-tool/58000100#comment102406634_58000100"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":8942728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cccb12a4392c3713855914bc8815673?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8942728/ryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568840071,"post_id":58000100,"comment_id":102406976,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999502/scraping-table-from-state-of-texas-query-tool/58000100#comment102406976_58000100"},{"owner":{"reputation":838,"user_id":11596424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIFWH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LuckyZakary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11596424/luckyzakary"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9,"user_id":8942728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cccb12a4392c3713855914bc8815673?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8942728/ryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568840090,"post_id":58000100,"comment_id":102406982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999502/scraping-table-from-state-of-texas-query-tool/58000100#comment102406982_58000100"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":838,"user_id":11596424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIFWH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LuckyZakary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11596424/luckyzakary"},"last_editor":{"reputation":838,"user_id":11596424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIFWH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LuckyZakary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11596424/luckyzakary"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568839456,"last_edit_date":1568839456,"creation_date":1568837466,"answer_id":58000100,"question_id":57999502,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000100","body_markdown":"I tried your code with a user agent and it worked.

As far as my exeprience goes, is this a reliable way of dealing with this kind of delay.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999500/htmlunit-not-return-completely-loaded-page-with-javascript/58027820#58027820","title":"HTMLUnit not return completely loaded page with JavaScript"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7866377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52785ae621f9502d6626d4e2f250ea77?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nementaarion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7866377/nementaarion"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7866377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52785ae621f9502d6626d4e2f250ea77?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nementaarion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7866377/nementaarion"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58027820,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568980778,"creation_date":1568834339,"last_edit_date":1568835031,"question_id":57999500,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999500","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get the content of the web [page](https://r.onliner.by/pk/#bounds%5Blb%5D%5Blat%5D=53.83186504485333&amp;bounds%5Blb%5D%5Blong%5D=27.39028930664063&amp;bounds%5Brt%5D%5Blat%5D=53.96497315018515&amp;bounds%5Brt%5D%5Blong%5D=27.73361206054688), namely the right side of the page with the list of apartments (div elements with class=&quot;classified&quot;).
