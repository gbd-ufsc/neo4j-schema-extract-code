I read this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14523468/redirecting-to-previous-page-after-login-php and modified the code to fit my needs, but something isn&#39;t working. The GET tags appear in the headers but it does not recognize them.\r\n\r\nI have done many things to try to get this to work, including binding it to multiple variables, removing the leading slash, using single and double quotes, and quite literally removing any header redirect that was not to the previous page, yet none of them worked. \r\n\r\nOn the Page &quot;lunchindex.php&quot;\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n// Initialize the session\r\nsession_start();\r\n\r\n// Check if the user is logged in, if not then redirect him to login page\r\nif(!isset($_SESSION[&quot;loggedin&quot;]) || $_SESSION[&quot;loggedin&quot;] !== true){\r\n    header(&quot;location: login.php?location=&quot;.urlencode($_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_URI&#39;]));\r\n    exit;\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n```\r\nAnd then on the page &quot;login.php&quot;\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\n// Initialize the session\r\nsession_start();\r\n$redirect = &quot;&quot;;\r\n// Get URL of Previous Page\r\n$url = NULL;\r\nif(isset($_GET[&#39;location&#39;])) {\r\n  $_GET[&#39;location&#39;] = ltrim($_GET[&#39;location&#39;], &#39;/&#39;);\r\n  $redirect = $_GET[&#39;location&#39;];\r\n  $url = $redirect;\r\n}\r\necho $url;\r\n//This creates text at the top of the page that says &quot;lunchindex.php&quot;, showing that it has the url.\r\n```\r\nThen under the part that redirects you when you are logged in,\r\n```\r\nif($url == NULL){\r\nheader(&quot;Location:account.php&quot;);\r\nexit();\r\n}else{\r\nheader(&#39;location:&#39;.$url);\r\nexit();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis always will redirect you to the account.php page. Even if you change the parameters so that it says ```if($url !== NULL){``` it will still redirect you to account.php, never lunchindex.php.

In both cases the majority of the time is spent in the JavaScript SDK, and on the wire between the client and server. For this reason I typically update directly through the JavaScript SDK, since it&#39;s often a bit more direct and the AngularFire abstraction has little advantage for me in write operations. Given that AngularFire is built on top of this SDK, it picks up the changes instantly even when they&#39;re not made through AngularFire. \r\n\r\nIf you have an instance where this does not seem to be the case, I recommend creating a question with the minimal, complete/standalone code that reproduces that problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261906/should-updates-to-firstore-items-in-angularfire-be-done-through-the-angularfires/58262414#58262414","title":"Should updates to Firstore items in AngularFire be done through the AngularFirestoreCollection?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3790,"user_id":522624,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ded0a8362b28cf099b3d6962ee2da60b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Granado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522624/david-granado"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58262414,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570409755,"creation_date":1570402920,"question_id":58261906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261906","body_markdown":"In my app, I have a list that requires an &quot;or&quot; condition.  But, as the [docs say](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries):\r\n\r\n&gt; In this case, you should create a separate query for each OR condition and merge the query results in your app.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in my service, I&#39;m managing two queries and surfacing them as a single observable list to consumers.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes in with updating.  I have the choice of doing extra work to match up the item needing update to the correct collection so I can do the following:\r\n\r\n```&#39;\r\nmyCollection.doc(item.id).update(item);\r\n```\r\n\r\nor I can make this much more simple and just:\r\n\r\n```\r\nangularFirestore.doc(`path/to/${item.id}`).update(item);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m operating under the assumption that the first method will result in faster updates as I&#39;m using the same reference that it would optimistically update instantly.  And that the latter will be slower in that it would be more round about by updating the persistence layer and then the collection referencing getting notified about later (probably still a small time).\r\n\r\nAll of the above is assumption, however.  I back this just with a few random instances where I&#39;ve seen it take a second or two for an update or delete to show up in an other part of the view, but I haven&#39;t been able to actually inspect the process.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if the above is correct?

This is not an *unreasonable* assumption, as Git is weird, but it throws your whole question off a bit.\r\n\r\nIn Git, branch *names* don&#39;t really mean as much as most people think they do, at least at first.  A branch name simply holds the hash ID of some existing commit.  There&#39;s an underlying entity that people *also* call &quot;a branch&quot;, and it consists of some or all of the commits that are *reachable from* the tip commit as defined by the branch name.  For (much) more about this, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/25068543/1256452 and [Think Like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/), but let&#39;s try for a quick summary:\r\n\r\n * What Git is really all about is *commits*.  Each commit is identified by its own unique hash ID.  No other commit can ever have this hash ID.  The contents of a commit include a snapshot—made from the index, rather than from the work-tree, but I will try not to get into all those hairy details here—and include the name and email address of the author of the commit, the same for the committer (usually the same person), and two date-and-time-stamps: one for author, one for committer.  They also include the log message the committer supplied at the time he/she/they/pronoun-of-choice made the commit.  Perhaps most importantly, the contents of a commit include the raw hash IDs of any commits that should be considered immediate predecessors of that commit.\r\n\r\n * In other words, each commit has some set of *parent* hash IDs, most commonly just one hash ID.  These parent IDs make commits form backwards-looking chains: from a *last* commit, we can go back to a previous commit.  From there, we can go back one more step, and so on.  So if a branch name like `master` holds the hash ID of the *last* commit we should consider to be part of the branch, the remaining commits are that commit&#39;s parent(s), the parent(s) of the parent(s), and so on.  If the hash ID of the `master` tip commit is `H` and its parent is `G` and `G`&#39;s parent is `F` and so on, we have:\r\n\r\n        ... &lt;-F &lt;-G &lt;-H   &lt;-- master\r\n\r\n and that&#39;s what a branch is: it&#39;s either the name, or the series of commits ending at `H`, or both: we tend to have to guess what someone means when they say &quot;the `master` branch&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhat `git branch --merged` does is:\r\n\r\n * Find the hash ID of the current branch (`HEAD`).\r\n * For all branch names *B* &lt;s&gt;skipping over the current branch (as read from `HEAD`)&lt;/s&gt; oops: Git *doesn&#39;t* skip the current branch, which is sort of annoying:\r\n   * Is the commit identified by *B* an ancestor of the commit identified by `HEAD`?&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  If so, print the name *B*.  In any case, move on to the next name.\r\n\r\nSo if part of the graph looks like:\r\n\r\n                 I--J   &lt;-- feature2\r\n                /\r\n    ...--F--G--H   &lt;-- master (HEAD)\r\n          \\\r\n           K--L   &lt;-- feature1\r\n\r\nthe two commits that `git branch --merged` will test are `J` and `L`, as compared to the current commit `H`.  If `J` is an ancestor of `H`—but it&#39;s not—this would print `feature2`.  If `L` is an ancestor of `H`—but it&#39;s not—this would print `feature1`.  Of course, `H` is an ancestor of `H`, so this *does* print `master` (with a prefix `*` to indicate that it is the current branch).\r\n\r\nIf there&#39;s a *fourth* name that points to any of `F`, `G`, `H`, or any of the commits &quot;behind&quot; `F`, `git branch --merged` will print *that* name, too.\r\n\r\nI *think* what you want is to print all names that point to any of the commits that are truly ancestors, and not any names that point directly to commit `H`.  The simplest way to do that is probably to let `git branch --merged` print everything, then remove from the list any name whose hash ID matches that of `HEAD`.\r\n\r\nTo remove such names, use `git rev-parse` on each name.  Use `git rev-parse HEAD` to find the hash ID of the current branch, i.e., the actual hash ID for `H` in the drawing above.  Then, using `git rev-parse` again on each name from `git branch --merged`, if the result is the same as the first `git rev-parse`, discard that name.  Otherwise, keep that name.\r\n\r\n(You will have to write a little bit of code for this.  If `git for-each-ref` could do `--not` and combine some boolean expressions, it could probably be done with that, but it doesn&#39;t do `--not` and combining.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The is-ancestor test that Git uses allows equality, i.e., it&#39;s ≤ rather than &lt; (or more precisely, precedes-or-equals, ≼, vs ≺).  This is also true for `git merge --is-ancestor`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261902/git-command-to-list-merged-branches/58262060#58262060","title":"Git Command to List Merged Branches"}],"owner":{"reputation":2164,"user_id":960115,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZ1UM.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeff G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/960115/jeff-g"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570405590,"creation_date":1570402849,"question_id":58261902,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261902","body_markdown":"Is there a way to list the branches that have been **merged** into the current working tree?

I mean it is fills up, but it is puts 2 or 3 (depends on the current percentage) symbols at once, and when it counts up to another 10% it puts 2-3 symbols again until 100%\r\n\r\nI tried everything in my knowledge (I just started programming a few weeks ago), but the only way I can make it to fill up one by one is that I take the length of the bar and iterate through it. Thats not what I want because then the percentage depends on how many list elements are filled up. And thats not good because I dont want to make a 100 characters long list just to count up the &#39;percentage&#39; one by one, and not every 5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n for example: Last time I made a 20 character long list that means when the last element is filled up it is 100% but in this case I have to add +5 to the count variable each loop. but if I want it to make to a 10 char long list and after 1 loop it adds 5 to the count variable then the max &#39;percent&#39; that I got is 50.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\n\r\ndef bar(blen):\r\n\r\n    progress = []\r\n\r\n    for p in range(blen):\r\n        progress.append(&#39; &#39;)\r\n\r\n    count = 0\r\n    while True:\r\n        count += 1\r\n        sleep(0.1)\r\n        for i in progress:\r\n            indx = progress.index(i)\r\n            if count == 10:\r\n                percent = (blen * 10) // 100\r\n                for m in range(percent + 1):\r\n                    progress[m] = &#39;■&#39;\r\n\r\n            elif count == 20:\r\n                percent = (blen * 20) // 100\r\n                for m in range(percent + 1):\r\n                    progress[m] = &#39;■&#39;\r\n\r\n            elif count == 30:\r\n                percent = (blen * 30) // 100\r\n                for m in range(percent + 1):\r\n                    progress[m] = &#39;■&#39;\r\n\r\n        print(&#39;&#39;.join(progress), count, end=&#39;\\r&#39;)\r\n\r\n        if count &gt;= 100:\r\n            break\r\n\r\n\r\nbar(19)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in this code above I got it right, that after every 10% it fills up the right amount, after passing every 10%, but I want it to fill up one by one depending on the % of the count variable.

that generates these tags dynamically via the Google Tag Manager and injects them in the HTML code via JavaScript, but I would like to generate these tags locally and inject them in the html files as a permanent solution.\r\n\r\nThe site&#39;s URL structure is as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.example.com/category1&lt;br/&gt;\r\nhttps://www.example.com/category2&lt;br/&gt;\r\n...&lt;br/&gt;\r\nhttps://www.example.com/file1&lt;br/&gt;\r\nhttps://www.example.com/file2&lt;br/&gt;\r\n...&lt;br/&gt;\r\nhttps://www.example.com/products/widget/PRODUCTID

We can express that as a set and then exclude it from the result of solveset:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [7]: _n = Symbol(&#39;_n&#39;, integer=True)                                                                                                                       \r\n\r\nIn [8]: sol = Union(ImageSet(Lambda(_n, 2*_n*pi + pi/2), Integers), ImageSet(Lambda(_n, 2*_n*pi + 3*pi/2), Integers))                                         \r\n\r\nIn [9]: sol                                                                                                                                                   \r\nOut[9]: \r\n⎧         π         ⎫   ⎧         3⋅π         ⎫\r\n⎨2⋅π⋅_n + ─ | _n ∊ ℤ⎬ ∪ ⎨2⋅π⋅_n + ─── | _n ∊ ℤ⎬\r\n⎩         2         ⎭   ⎩          2          ⎭\r\n\r\nIn [10]: exclude = ImageSet(Lambda(_n, _n*pi + pi/2), Integers)                                                                                               \r\n\r\nIn [11]: exclude                                                                                                                                              \r\nOut[11]: \r\n⎧       π         ⎫\r\n⎨π⋅_n + ─ | _n ∊ ℤ⎬\r\n⎩       2         ⎭\r\n\r\nIn [12]: sol - exclude                                                                                                                                        \r\nOut[12]: \r\n⎛⎧         π         ⎫   ⎧       π         ⎫⎞   ⎛⎧         3⋅π         ⎫   ⎧       π         ⎫⎞\r\n⎜⎨2⋅π⋅_n + ─ | _n ∊ ℤ⎬ \\ ⎨π⋅_n + ─ | _n ∊ ℤ⎬⎟ ∪ ⎜⎨2⋅π⋅_n + ─── | _n ∊ ℤ⎬ \\ ⎨π⋅_n + ─ | _n ∊ ℤ⎬⎟\r\n⎝⎩         2         ⎭   ⎩       2         ⎭⎠   ⎝⎩          2          ⎭   ⎩       2         ⎭⎠\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately at this point SymPy isn&#39;t really simplifying things the way that it should (and `simplify` doesn&#39;t help). Ideally `sol` would simplify to `exclude` in the first place so that subtracting the two would gives the empty set but I guess that isn&#39;t implemented yet...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261797/sympy-how-to-handle-union-and-imageset/58261919#58261919","title":"SymPy: How to handle Union and ImageSet"}],"owner":{"reputation":1817,"user_id":2367231,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CeSBA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex44","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2367231/alex44"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1817,"user_id":2367231,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CeSBA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex44","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2367231/alex44"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570464949,"creation_date":1570401788,"last_edit_date":1570464949,"question_id":58261797,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261797","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to SymPy and `solveset`. I&#39;m looking for the singularity of an expression and for that I solve the denominator. Afterwards I want to use the results for further calculations to generate a code which deals with the singularity cases.\r\n\r\nThe return of &#39;solveset&#39; divers between different equations. In my case up to now:\r\n\r\n - `sets.FiniteSet`\r\n - `sets.Union`\r\n\r\nWhile `FiniteSet` can be used directly with for-loops, the `Union` can not.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nsol = Union(ImageSet(Lambda(_n, 2*_n*pi + pi/2), Integers), ImageSet(Lambda(_n, 2*_n*pi + 3*pi/2), Integers))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I put this into a loop (`for s in sol:`), the loop will never end. So this is useless. The `sol.is_interval` results to `False` while I expect a `True`.\r\n\r\nObserve the following example which detects a not allowed input:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef fun(x):\r\n    if (x+pi/2)%pi == 0:\r\n        print(&#39;Detect a not allowed input.&#39;)\r\n```\r\nwhere the `if`-condition must be derived from the solution `sol` from above.\r\n\r\n1. How can I determine if `Union` has a finite or infinite number elements?\r\n2. And how can I get one expression which is usable outside of this Set world?\r\n\r\n----\r\nThis chart explains what I want to do:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1] \r\n\r\nThe dark blue part on the left side is the code generator of the light blue part on the right side which can be a different programming language which is not able to handle things like infinity or division by zero. The dark blue part I am going to implement.\r\n\r\nCurrently I stuck on the block &quot;generation of\r\nSingularity handling&quot;, because the `Set` and there especially the `Union` are nice for printing but difficult if not useless for further processing.\r\n\r\nI tried to involve `solveset` because of the statement [at SymPy&#39;s documentation][2], that _&quot;sooner or later the solveset will take over solve either internally or externally&quot;_. Relating to my application I hope, this will not happen. Maybe I did not fully understand the mechanism of `sets`.\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\n- I also did not find a way to extract only one `ImageSet` hold in this `Union`. It looks for me that I can pack it but unpacking is not foreseen. But from my point of view this is essential for computing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fV5Ab.png\r\n  [2]: https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solvers.html?highlight=solve#module-sympy.solvers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261797/sympy-how-to-handle-union-and-imageset","title":"SymPy: How to handle Union and ImageSet"},{"tags":["vuetify.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":184,"user_id":6064354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1555241f2b4d3c67fa1c34f68427405e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jamy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6064354/jamy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570435175,"creation_date":1570435175,"answer_id":58265518,"question_id":58261795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265518","body_markdown":"You can&#39;t use `$vuetify.breakpoint` object in CSS directly.\r\n\r\nI have two alternative solutions, try this.\r\n\r\n\r\n**A.

For any given vertex *u ∈ V*, there is a &quot;copy&quot; vertex *u&#39; ∈ V&#39;*. And so there is also an *s&#39;* and a *t&#39;*. We do not include *F* or *F&#39;* at this point.\r\n\r\nThen define a set of edges *F&#176;* as *(u,v&#39;)*, for each edge *(u,v) ∈ F*. So these edges in *F&#176;* are *passable* connections from *V* to *V&#39;* -- in that direction only. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s call this new graph, *G&#176;(V&#176;, E&#176;)*, where *V&#176; = V + V&#39;*, *E&#176; = D + D&#39; + F&#176;*, and *F&#176;* as defined in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nNow solve the problem of going from *s* to *{t, t&#39;}* in *G&#176;*. As there are no edges from *V&#39;* to *V*, a solution path ending in *t&#39;* will only use one edge *(u,v&#39;)* from *F&#176;*. Note that if *t* is reached via a shorter path than *t&#39;*, this means that no edge from *F&#176;* is used (no impassable road needs to be plowed).\r\n\r\nThe problem of finding the shortest path between *s* and *{t, t&#39;}* in *G&#176;* is now a standard problem that can be solved with Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm. One additional thing is needed: For each visited *w&#39; ∈ V&#39;*, the edge *(u,v&#39;)* from *F&#176;* -- that was crossed to get there -- needs to be logged. This information should just get passed on to the next vertex that the algorithm visits, so that when *t&#39;* is finally found, the answer can be given immediately, i.e. that edge *(u,v&#39;)*.\r\n\r\nThe number of edges visited in this algorithm is at most *|E&#176;| = |D + D&#39; + F&#176;| ≤ 2|E| = O(|E|)*. The algorithm visits every edge only once, so the time complexity is *O(|E|)*.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261758/dijkstras-algorithm-to-find-shortest-path/58274889#58274889","title":"Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm to find shortest path"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":12157488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CDMxW0qtxcs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdZba64_aI-BDYHogaMp0tRt9UAWg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ran wty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157488/ran-wty"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8926706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19be50eea5f6f98c1abc975e2564f26f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"D.dream","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8926706/d-dream"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":117,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570510586,"creation_date":1570401316,"last_edit_date":1570418715,"question_id":58261758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261758","body_markdown":"A particular state has a set of E roads among its set of V cities, where the time to traverse the road from city u to a neighbor city v is given by cuv. (Note that cuv need not equal cvu – in fact there may be no road from v to u.) After a snowstorm, some of the roads are impasable, but the governor needs to drive from city s to city t very soon, so soon that there is time to clear only one of the impassable roads. Give an O(E log V ) algorithm that determines which road to plow (one only) in order to achieve the minimum possible time path from a city s to city t. The input is a list of all the roads, the values cuv for each road, s, t, and the set of impassable roads. If road clearing is of no help, the algorithm should say so.\r\n\r\nI think the closest way to approach to this question is using Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm to find the shortest path, however, since we don&#39;t know which road is impassable and which road is passable, Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm seems inappropriate for this question. So, is there any other algorithm that able to check the condition of each edge and find the shortest path?

I tried to inherit from native Ldap ... but its ldap property is private, so I just copied the entire Ldap to myself and renamed it to CustomLdapBindAuthenticationProvider.

Your `main` returns after calling `time.Sleep()` and then sending `true` on `done`.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the goroutine that&#39;s in the `for` loop awakens when the `true` value arrives on the `done` channel.  This happens after the main goroutine has sent it, after which the main goroutine is in the process of exiting.\r\n\r\nIf, in this process of exiting, the main goroutine takes long enough, the anonymous goroutine will have time to print `Received &#39;done&#39;`.  If, in this process of exiting, the main goroutine is speedy enough, the anonymous goroutine never finishes, or maybe never even starts, printing anything, and you see nothing.  (The actual output is accomplished by a single underlying system call so you either get all of it, or none of it.)\r\n\r\nYou can make sure the goroutine you spun off finishes before having your main one exit by any number of mechanisms, but the simplest is probably to use `sync.WaitGroup` since it&#39;s kind of designed for that.

start by building a base query, that gives us the current level of each customer on each and every day. \r\n\r\nThis works by recovering all available days in the table, then all prior records to each day, and finally aggregating to compute the current level of each `(customer, item)` tuple. \r\n\r\nThe underlying assumption is that that the level of a tuple cannot decrease (this is consistent with your sample data).\r\n\r\n\tselect\r\n\t\td.day,\r\n\t\tt.customer, \r\n\t\tt.items,\r\n\t\tmax(t.levels) max_level\r\n\tfrom \r\n\t\t(select distinct day from mytable) d\r\n\t\tleft join mytable t on

level of (conditional) aggregation.\r\n\r\nThis query gives you the distribution of customers of `item1` per date across levels 1 to 5:\r\n\r\n\tselect \r\n\t\tday,\r\n\t\tsum( (max_level = 0)::int )

I&#39;m writing a .Net Core web api that is consumed by a JavaScript frontend. There is a `Parent` and `Child` class. In the child class I wanted to implement a weakly typed field where I could put in any `JSON` value, just a regular key/value store. That&#39;s my setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Child\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public string Type { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public BsonDocument Properties { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic class Parent\r\n{\r\n   [BsonId]\r\n   [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)]\r\n   public string Id { get; set; }\r\n\r\n   public List&lt;Child&gt; Children { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the database a parent element may look as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;_id&quot; : 1,\r\n    &quot;Children&quot; : [\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;_id&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;Type&quot; : &quot;TEXT&quot;,\r\n        &quot;Properties&quot; : {\r\n            &quot;Width&quot; : 100,\r\n            &quot;Height&quot; : 100,\r\n            &quot;Color&quot; : &quot;red&quot;\r\n        }\r\n   }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reading from the database is working that way. MongoDB is deserializing the data and everything is ok. The issue I have is on the controller level. That&#39;s the fairly simple Controller code:\r\n```\r\n[HttpGet]\r\npublic ActionResult&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt; Get()\r\n{\r\n   // _parentRepository.Get() is returning a List&lt;Parent&gt; read from the DB\r\n   return _parentRepository.Get();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I send a request to the API that&#39;s the result I&#39;m getting:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;id&quot; : 1,\r\n    &quot;children&quot; : [\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;TEXT&quot;,\r\n        &quot;properties&quot; : [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Width&quot;,\r\n                &quot;value&quot;: 100\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Height&quot;,\r\n                &quot;value&quot;: 100\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Color&quot;,\r\n                &quot;value&quot;: &quot;red&quot;\r\n            }\r\n       ]\r\n\r\n   }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as you can see the `BsonDocument` is serialized like a dictionary where it&#39;s a list of key/value pairs. I would prefer to have a flat JSON there, so a representation exactly like in the database.\r\n\r\nI tried with `JsonResult` and an explicit cast to `Controller.Json()`, but the result was the same.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I&#39;m using `.NET Core 2.2`! I know 3.0 has introduced some changes related to JSON, but haven&#39;t been able to update the project yet.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261705/serializing-weak-typed-bsondocument-to-json-in-controller","title":"Serializing weak typed BsonDocument to JSON in controller"},{"tags":["angular","ionic-framework","ionic4","angular-router"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3690,"user_id":4005366,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b42e7e7888cd46f17946f04e8233bc77?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sergey Rudenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4005366/sergey-rudenko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570479394,"post_id":58261704,"comment_id":102919609,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261704/ionic-angular-reset-navigation-history#comment102919609_58261704"},{"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":11899771,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDlti.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alexortizl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11899771/alexortizl"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3690,"user_id":4005366,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b42e7e7888cd46f17946f04e8233bc77?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sergey Rudenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4005366/sergey-rudenko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570488258,"post_id":58261704,"comment_id":102922287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261704/ionic-angular-reset-navigation-history#comment102922287_58261704"}],"owner":{"reputation":74,"user_id":11899771,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDlti.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alexortizl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11899771/alexortizl"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570400754,"creation_date":1570400754,"question_id":58261704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261704","body_markdown":"I&#39;m building an Ionic 4 Angular App. In my app I have three routes `/login`, `/createAccount` and `/home`.

am trying to create an object structure like this\r\nUniverse - contains a collection of Worlds\r\nWorlds contains a collection of areas.\r\n\r\nAll 3 of these types extend from a base class which has a property of &#39;ParentObject&#39;.\r\nWorlds will reference the Universe via this property.\r\nAreas will reference the world via this property.\r\n\r\nWhen running a test harness application.\r\n\r\n```\r\n            Universe universe = Universe.GetInstance();\r\n            var world = universe.CreateWorld();\r\n            var area = world.CreateArea();\r\n\r\n            area.UpdateIpfs();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdateIpfs on the area object - then recurses upwards from area to world to universe - serializing each tier and then adding to the Ipfs network. (Thats just where I am storing the json data)\r\n\r\nIn order to get the objects back\r\nI do\r\n\r\n```\r\n            Universe universe = Universe.GetInstance(&quot;QmZnaSaDNnmqhUrE8kFHeu9PGGStAr2D4q3Vt88yHwFvzG&quot;);\r\n            var world = universe.Worlds[0];\r\n            var area = world.Areas[0];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nStepping through the code I can see the json content is this before deserialization:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n  &quot;ParentObject&quot;: null,\r\n  &quot;Worlds&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,\r\n      &quot;ParentObject&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;1&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;Time&quot;: &quot;2019-10-06T23:13:56.6002056+01:00&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Name&quot;: null,\r\n      &quot;Description&quot;: null,\r\n      &quot;Areas&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;3&quot;,\r\n          &quot;EventScripts&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;$id&quot;: &quot;4&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          &quot;ParentObject&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;2&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          &quot;Name&quot;: null,\r\n          &quot;IsInterior&quot;: false,\r\n          &quot;IsUnderground&quot;: false,\r\n          &quot;IsArtificial&quot;: false,\r\n          &quot;Description&quot;: null,\r\n          &quot;X&quot;: 0,\r\n          &quot;Y&quot;: 0,\r\n          &quot;Z&quot;: 0,\r\n          &quot;AreaObjects&quot;: [],\r\n          &quot;ObjType&quot;: &quot;BloodlinesLib.Engine.World.Area, BloodlinesLib, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&quot;,\r\n          &quot;Hash&quot;: &quot;QmbM86GZn6w9JadBM143fDYwGisgNPGXke3bFxpXzrfgJh&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      &quot;ObjType&quot;: &quot;BloodlinesLib.Engine.World.World, BloodlinesLib, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Hash&quot;: &quot;QmRnEfndUDjCTifY694YuftPNWSRHQQJn9WwZmSpUBRJmv&quot;\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;ObjType&quot;: &quot;BloodlinesLib.Engine.World.Universe, BloodlinesLib, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&quot;,\r\n  &quot;Hash&quot;: null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see that the ParentObject for the area object is $ref: 2\r\nWhich seems to match the Id of the World object.\r\n\r\nBut when I deserialize - the ParentObject on the &#39;Area&#39;

I&#39;m trying to improve the loading of a dimensional data warehouse.  I need to load tens of thousands of records each time I run the loading operation; sometimes I need to load hundreds of thousands of records; semi-annually I need to load millions of records.\r\n\r\nFor the loading operation, I build an in-memory record corresponding to a 48-column Fact table record which is to be updated or inserted (depending on whether a previous version of the record is already in the Fact table).  The in-memory record includes about 2 dozen foreign key pointers to various dimension tables.  I have indexes on all of those Fact table foreign keys (and of course I can disable those indexes while loading the data warehouse).  \r\n\r\nAfter populating the in-memory record with fresh data for the Fact table record, I add it to the Fact table (update or insert, as above).\r\n\r\nI am wondering if I could improve performance in update situations by updating only those columns which have changed, instead of mindlessly updating every column in the Fact table record.  Doing this would add some overhead in that my loading program would become more complex.  But would I gain any benefit anyway?  Suppose for example that one of those dimension table foreign keys hasn&#39;t changed.  Is there going to be a performance benefit if I do not update that particular column?  I guess it comes down to whether SQL Server internally tracks (counts??) foreign key references between the Fact and dimension tables.  If SQL Server does do such tracking, then perhaps there would be a performance benefit if I do not update the column, since then SQL Server would not need to perform its internal tracking operation.  But if SQL Server does not do such tracking then I suppose that I should just update all 48 Fact table columns regardless of whether they have changed or not, since that would avoid adding complexity &amp; overhead to my loading program.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d appreciate any comments or suggestions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261690/performance-improvement-by-selective-updating-of-fact-table-columns-in-dimension","title":"Performance improvement by selective updating of Fact table columns in dimensional data warehouse"},{"tags":["javascript","export","es6-modules"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1768,"user_id":989920,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01e16ed8a3bc3246278001359f7a0257?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"evolutionxbox","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/989920/evolutionxbox"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570401613,"post_id":58261689,"comment_id":102891962,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261689/what-is-the-reasoning-behind-exporting-from-another-module#comment102891962_58261689"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570403405,"creation_date":1570403405,"answer_id":58261937,"question_id":58261689,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58261937","body_markdown":"It allows for greater modular organization.

The attribute given by `attr` automatically reads dot notation, and so you can use it to do some nifty tricks. It also has some handling to attempt `.__getitem__()` if there is no attribute (`obj[attr]`)\r\n\r\nThe downside is that `getattr_loop` will give you a `RecursionError` if you have a really deeply nested attribute in `obj`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if one uses the Numpy module as the object:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; getattr_loop(np,&#39;random.rand&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to access `np.random.rand`. If you use `globals()` as is used in the code snippet, it will grab all objects defined at the global scope. So, a user of the above code snippet can type &#39;np.sin&#39; as the function, and the code will compute `np.sin(collection)`.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use `sin` directly, you&#39;ll need to import that directly into the namespace.\r\n\r\n**Caveat about security**\r\n\r\nGrabbing things from `globals()` can be risky from a security perspective. If you need this to be secure, make sure to:\r\n\r\n - sanitise your inputs\r\n - construct an object which only contains the functions that you want someone to be able to access, lest you accidentally allow someone to patch into something like `os.remove` and do some harm...\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261679/get-an-expression-as-an-input-in-python/58261913#58261913","title":"Get an expression as an input in python"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12172700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0df1eedb71749ba8ed935c254e564476?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MATh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12172700/math"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570405104,"post_id":58262033,"comment_id":102892522,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261679/get-an-expression-as-an-input-in-python/58262033#comment102892522_58262033"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1118,"user_id":3066077,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1666991815/picture?type=large","display_name":"DarrylG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3066077/darrylg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1118,"user_id":3066077,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1666991815/picture?type=large","display_name":"DarrylG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3066077/darrylg"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570405005,"last_edit_date":1570405005,"creation_date":1570404665,"answer_id":58262033,"question_id":58261679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58262033","body_markdown":"This code should work for expressions in x such as x*sin(x) + (x+1)*exp(2*x)\r\n\r\n    from math import *   # import sin, cos, tan, etc. into globals\r\n                         # to allow use by eval\r\n    \r\n    def function_creator(arr): \r\n      &quot; allows expressions such as x*sin(x) + x &quot;\r\n      expr = input(&quot;Enter the function(in terms of x):&quot;)\r\n      # x is bound locally inside the list comprehension for use by eval\r\n      return [eval(expr) for x in arr]  # compute expression on each data element\r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: \r\n      collection = list()\r\n      number = input(&quot;Enter the number of elements you want: &quot;)\r\n      for i in range(int(number)):\r\n        n = input(&quot;Enter number:&quot;)\r\n        collection.append(float(n))\r\n      print (&#39;ARRAY: &#39;,collection)\r\n      result = function_creator(collection)\r\n      print(result)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58261679/get-an-expression-as-an-input-in-python/58262033#58262033","title":"Get an expression as an input in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12172700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0df1eedb71749ba8ed935c254e564476?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MATh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12172700/math"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12172700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0df1eedb71749ba8ed935c254e564476?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MATh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12172700/math"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58262033,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570405005,"creation_date":1570400538,"last_edit_date":1570402233,"question_id":58261679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58261679","body_markdown":"I have an array of numbers that the user input.
