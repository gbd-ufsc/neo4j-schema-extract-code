For instance if there is a service cert, two intermediates CAs, and a root CA, the expected handshake would have 3 certs.  &quot;all minus the root&quot;\r\n\r\ni am writing some code that uses System.Net.Security.SSLStream.  Its easy to get the server cert (RemoteCertificate property after AuthenticateAsClient()), and easy to get the chain (there is a method in an X509Chain object that accepts an x509v2 and &quot;builds&quot; the chain)\r\n\r\nWhat I am interested in is getting the certs as presented by the SSL server during the SSl/TLS Handshake... basically i want to know if the server sent the right set of certs (all minus root), or an incomplete set (server cert, but missing some or all intermediates.. hope the client already knows them), or an inappropriate set (all including the root... don&#39;t tell clients who to trust, it&#39;s none of your business)\r\n\r\nin openssl (not useful for my circumstance, but as an example) you can get the exact list of certs the server provided\r\n\r\n\tC:\\Program Files\\openssl&gt;openssl s_client -connect xxxxxx:443\r\n\tWARNING: can&#39;t open config file: /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf\r\n\tCONNECTED(00000214)\r\n\tdepth=1 DC = loc, DC = xxxxx, DC = xxxx, CN = prod-xxxxxxx-CA\r\n\tverify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate\r\n\t---\r\n\tCertificate chain\r\n\t 0 s:/C=US/ST=xxx/L=xxxx/O=xxxxxx/OU=IT Infrastructure Services/CN=xxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.loc/emailAddress=xxxxx.xxxxx@xxxxxx.com\r\n\t   i:/DC=loc/DC=xxxxx/DC=xxxx/CN=prod-xxxxxxx-CA\r\n\t 1 s:/DC=loc/DC=xxxxx/DC=xxxx/CN=prod-xxxxxxx-CA\r\n\t   i:/C=US/ST=xxx/L=xxxx/O=xxxxxx/OU=IT Infrastructure Services/CN=XXXX XXXX XXXX Root CA 2016\r\n\t---\r\n\tServer certificate\r\n\t-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n\tMIIH+zCCBeOgAwIBAgITFAAEIo5+ju3K+O0+1AAAAAQijjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQ0F\r\n\tADBhMRMwEQYKCZImiZPyLGQBGRYDbG9\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see that this SSL handshake sent a server cert, and the cert of the CA that issued the server cert, which was signed by an issuer (we can assume would be the root ca, i.e. the 3rd cert, not presented, would have been self signed)\r\n\r\nBesides showing the certs as presented, openssl also shows depth of 1 (meaning one more than the server cert).. which though it is not as functional as actually describing the chain, would be enough information for my goals (I could make an educated guess on the certs that were sent during the handshake if I knew depth, even if I didn&#39;t have x509v2 objects for each).\r\n\r\nI can of course ask SCHANNEL (Windows Operating System SSL/TLS tunnels) to get the x509v2 object&#39;s chain.\r\n\r\n    $chain = [Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain]::create()\r\n    $isValid = $chain.Build($certificate)\r\n\r\nbut this appears to build the chain behind the scenes with however the schannel dll wants, and technically it appears to do it by actually getting the crt files of each CA in the chain from the url(s) embedded in the cert(s) AIA records.  But no matter how this is done, I cant find any marker that lets me know which certs were in the handshake, which certs were found in the client cert store(s), and which certs were retrieved from the internet.. in order to &quot;build&quot; a healthy X509Chain.\r\n\r\nSo here is some quick PowerShell code (where $target = fqdn or ip of a resource that has a SSL server, and $port is the port of said service) this simplified code cannot handle STARTTLS (so no smtp, ldap, ftp via STARTTLS).

I could ask how to create a simple if statement in Java, and 5 people would comment saying they needed more information before they could answer the question. What new information has been produced, yet I was able to answer this question?  How would it have been beneficial for me to explain every detail of a project I&#39;ve been working on for the better part of 2 years, or to show a dump of every value in my database, just so someone could tell me how to use QueryAddColumn?  Not all questions are cryptic, and this one was pretty straightforward.  Try to think with the information provided to you, some people are working with sensitive data, and in my case, sharing my code is the quickest way for me to become unemployed.  I feel that this happens a lot on Stack Overflow, and 9 times out of 10, I don&#39;t think people are trying to hide anything from you, they&#39;re just trying to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful to someone in the future.

If you have another solution, please send it my way.  \r\n\r\nI have two arrays being passed as form variables from a report page to a print page. These arrays are built as the user goes through the report, and checks checkboxes. I need to do a query based on the two arrays.  One array contains numbers, the other array contains database table names.  There is no current size limit for the array, but I don&#39;t see it ever going over 100 values, so I can say the number of array values in each array will always be equal, but could range from 1 - 100 values.  My problem is that the tables array contains a list of tables, with many repeating values.  The number that goes with each table is at the same index of the tables array as the number it goes with in the numbers array, so they&#39;re matched on idex.  \r\n\r\nSo something like this:\r\n\r\n    NUMBERS {1, 5, 15, 8}\r\n\r\n    TABLES {THISTAB1, THISTAB1, THISTAB2, THISTAB3}\r\n\r\nIs there a way to combine these two into a query-able object?  I would like to be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;cfquery&gt;\r\n        SELECT NUMBERS FROM CREATEDQUERY\r\n        WHERE TABLENAME = THISTAB1\r\n    &lt;/cfquery&gt;\r\n\r\nUsing the sample data, the result set should be something like this:\r\n\r\n    Results {1,5}\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be very appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125083/how-to-combine-two-arrays-into-a-usable-cfquery-or-similar-solution","title":"How to combine two arrays into a usable cfquery, or similar solution?"},{"tags":["python","namespaces","python-import","python-module"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":40972,"user_id":523612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ae512dd708a619496d36b1f681f95e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Karl Knechtel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/523612/karl-knechtel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569534680,"post_id":58125080,"comment_id":102638694,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125080/why-is-my-python-package-being-imported-as-a-namespace-module-and-how-can-i-i#comment102638694_58125080"},{"owner":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569535381,"post_id":58125080,"comment_id":102638881,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125080/why-is-my-python-package-being-imported-as-a-namespace-module-and-how-can-i-i#comment102638881_58125080"},{"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":10273808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7649685d5b725b0cd2cfb31808b5b152?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jaib1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10273808/jaib1"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569542035,"post_id":58125080,"comment_id":102640121,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125080/why-is-my-python-package-being-imported-as-a-namespace-module-and-how-can-i-i#comment102640121_58125080"},{"owner":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569574419,"post_id":58125080,"comment_id":102649124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125080/why-is-my-python-package-being-imported-as-a-namespace-module-and-how-can-i-i#comment102649124_58125080"},{"owner":{"reputation":795,"user_id":858675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c51db176e8886a2afbc18edd2233c18b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gelonida","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/858675/gelonida"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569574539,"post_id":58125080,"comment_id":102649183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125080/why-is-my-python-package-being-imported-as-a-namespace-module-and-how-can-i-i#comment102649183_58125080"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":10273808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7649685d5b725b0cd2cfb31808b5b152?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jaib1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10273808/jaib1"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569533858,"creation_date":1569533858,"question_id":58125080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58125080","body_markdown":"I have two packages I am trying to play with in an IPython console.

Seriously. [You could summon cthulhu.][1]\r\n\r\nThat being said, if you know your `&lt;label&gt;` tags are only on one line, are all properly formatted, and you&#39;re *really* determined to use regex, this will do the trick:\r\n\r\n`&lt;label.*?&gt;.*?:(.*?)&lt;\\/label&gt;`\r\n\r\nIt gets an opening `label` tag, reads to the first instance of a colon, and then captures everything after that until it hits the label&#39;s close tag. [See a demo here.][2]\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;This only works for your posted examples.&lt;/b&gt; If there&#39;s another attribute after the label, or you have nested label tags (for some reason), or a colon appears anywhere else in the label, the regex is going to break. If you&#39;re already in JS, it&#39;s probably a much better idea to just use `element.innerText` to get the text and then alter it that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/7431860\r\n  [2]: https://regex101.com/r/w9jQL8/1/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125076/split-all-form-inputs-on-colon-and-wrap-in-span/58125179#58125179","title":"Split all form inputs on colon and wrap in span"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3267,"user_id":217867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQpud.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lonnie Best","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/217867/lonnie-best"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3267,"user_id":217867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQpud.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lonnie Best","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/217867/lonnie-best"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569539938,"last_edit_date":1569539938,"creation_date":1569535998,"answer_id":58125393,"question_id":58125076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125393","body_markdown":"I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re simply curious how to automate this as an **editing task** (one that seems repetitive to do manually in your code editor).\r\n\r\nEven though it is easy enough to do this manually for 4 inputs, you could indeed accomplish it also with a regular expression instead.\r\n\r\nA regular expression similar to `/(?&lt;=: )[^&lt;]+/gm;` can assist in finding and replacing in the manner you&#39;ve described.

R and Python with Vantage | Part 1: Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjgFWBc2kTM\r\n\r\n**A: Client-side options**\r\n\r\nThe “tdplyr” R add-on library (freely available at downloads.teradata.com) builds on the “dplyr” foundation specifically for interaction with Vantage servers. In addition to the functions provided by &quot;dplyr&quot; it also provides R wrappers for about 100+ analytic functions in the newly introduced Machine Learning Engine (MLE) component of Vantage systems, and 9 analytic functions in the Advanced SQL Engine (ASQLE; the former Teradata Database) component of Vantage systems. The Teradata R package for clients, “tdplyr”, thus enables both data wrangling and seamless in-database analytics with data straight from the database, thereby relieving customers from having to move any data from the database to the client and back.\r\n\r\n&quot;tdplyr&quot; documentation can be found at: \r\nhttps://docs.teradata.com/reader/EZAbQ2BX~vKBrWDQ3v7fPQ/qPSuQaTN2CYD~KUvLxY7mg.\r\n\r\nAnalytics with “tdplyr” are demonstrated in part 2 of the “R and Python with Vantage” TechBytes series at: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DCbTpWSLJI\r\n \r\n\r\n**B: In-nodes options**\r\n\r\nTeradata also offers in-nodes solutions for R users via the SCRIPT Table Operator (STO; since Teradata Database v.15.00) and the ExecR Table Operator (ExecR; since Teradata Database v.15.10). Both approaches enable users to bring their R scripts and execute them natively in-database on R interpreter instances that run on each ASQLE node. Because of the nature of the database architecture, this approach is most appropriate and effective for:\r\n\r\na) model scoring tasks, whereby an R script only needs one row of data as input to score it with a given model; for this reason, the scoring task takes place across all nodes extremely efficiently in what is known as an “embarrassingly parallel” task.\r\n\r\nb) fitting multiple models by partitioning a data table by some feature; in this scenario, each AMP (ASQLE database processing unit) processes all data of a single partition, and this results in simultaneous fitting of all models in a parallel fashion.\r\n\r\nA more complicated scenario is when the user wishes to fit a model with data from across the entire database; typically, these tasks involve operations in two steps, where the first step is executing a script that receives partial results from each AMP (“mapping” phase), and in the second step a second script needs to consume these partial answers to yield the final result (“reduce” phase). This approach puts the programming onus on the user (unlike the MLE analytic functions that perform this sequence of steps seamlessly to the user when fitting models from a client).\r\nMemory processing limit for ExecR is 3.5 GB per AMP.\r\n\r\n**B.1: ExecR**\r\n\r\nUsers can bring their R scripts directly into ExecR, yet the data input and output parts where the script interacts with the database need suitable modification by using the so-called FNC functions in ExecR. These are Teradata-built R functions that carry these data and metadata transfer tasks. A detailed ExecR documentation can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.teradata.com/reader/T5QsmcznbJo1bHmZT2KnFw/EabyaGA8DZhLIXy~uhzvsA\r\n\r\n\r\n**B.2: SCRIPT**\r\n\r\nSCRIPT Table Operator (STO): In this approach, the script receives data from a single table via the script’s standard input, needs to interpret the input data types correctly for R, and sends the results to the database (or the SQL interface) via the script’s standard output. Therefore, in this approach, the R script data input and output segments need to be composed accordingly prior to uploading the script to the database and executing it via the STO. Other than this, an instance of the script runs exactly on an R interpreter on each database AMP as it would run on a client.

a shorter reproduction, consider the difference between a program compiled with `ACCEPT` and a program without:\r\n\r\n    struct One { constexpr operator int() const { return 1; } };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    constexpr int foo(T&amp;&amp; t) {\r\n    #ifdef ACCEPT\r\n        return t;\r\n    #else\r\n        constexpr int i = t;\r\n        return i;\r\n    #endif\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    constexpr int i = foo(One{});\r\n\r\nAs my choice of macro might suggest, the `ACCEPT` case is ok and the other case is ill-formed. Why? The rule in question is [\\[expr.const\\]/4.12](http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.const#4.12):\r\n\r\n&gt; An expression `e` is a _core constant expression_ unless the evaluation of `e`, following the rules of the abstract machine, would evaluate one of the following: [...] an _id-expression_ that refers to a variable or data member of reference type unless the reference has a preceding initialization and either [...]\r\n\r\nWhat is _preceding initialization_? Before I answer that, lemme provide a different program and walk through what the semantics of it have to be:\r\n\r\n### A contradiction\r\n\r\n    struct Int { constexpr operator int() const { return i; } int i; };\r\n    template &lt;int&gt; struct X { };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    constexpr auto foo(T&amp;&amp; t) {\r\n        constexpr int i = t;\r\n        return X&lt;i&gt;{};\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    constexpr auto i = foo(Int{1});\r\n    constexpr auto j = foo(Int{2});\r\n\r\nThere is only one function `foo&lt;Int&gt;`, so it has to have one specific return type. If this program were allowed, then `foo(Int{1})` would return an `X&lt;1&gt;` and `foo(Int{2})` would return an `X&lt;2&gt;` -- that is, `foo&lt;Int&gt;` can return different types? This cannot happen, so this has to be ill-formed.\r\n\r\n### The smallest possible box\r\n\r\nWhen we&#39;re in a situation that requires a constant expression, think of it as opening a new box. Everything within that box must satisfy the rules of the constant evaluation as if we&#39;d just started from that point. If we require a new constant expression nested within that box, we open a new box. Boxes all the way down.\r\n\r\nIn both the original reproduction (with `One`) and the new reproduction (with `Int`), we have this declaration:\r\n\r\n    constexpr int i = t;\r\n\r\nThis opens a new box. The initializer, `t`, has to satisfy the restrictions of constant expressions. `t` is a reference type, but has no preceding initialization _within this box_, hence this is ill-formed. \r\n\r\nNow in the accepted case:\r\n\r\n    struct One { constexpr operator int() const { return 1; } };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    constexpr int foo(T&amp;&amp; t) {\r\n        return t;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    constexpr int i = foo(One{});\r\n\r\nWe only have the one box: the initialization of the global `i`. Within that box, we do still evaluate an _id-expression_ of reference type, within that `return t;`, but in this case we _do_ have a preceding initialization within our box: we have visibility where we bind `t` to `One{}`. So this works. There is no contradiction that can be constructed from these rules. Indeed, this would be fine too:\r\n\r\n    constexpr int j = foo(Int{1});\r\n    constexpr int k = foo(Int{2});\r\n    static_assert(i+k == 3);\r\n\r\nBecause we still just have the one entrance each time into constant evaluation, and within that evaluation, the reference `t` has preceding initialization, and the members of `Int` are usable in constant expressions also. \r\n\r\n### Back to the OP\r\n\r\nRemoving the reference works because we no longer violate the reference restriction, and there isn&#39;t any other restriction that we could violate. We&#39;re not reading any variable state or anything, the conversion function just returns a constant. \r\n\r\nA similar example where we tried to pass `Int{1}` to `foo` by value would still fail - not for the reference rule this time, but instead for the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion rule. Basically, we&#39;re reading something that we can&#39;t be allowed to read -- because we&#39;d end up with the same kind of contradiction of being able to construct a function with multiple return types.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125039/custom-type-conversion-operator-doesnt-work-when-invoked-on-a-forwarding-refere/58138085#58138085","title":"Custom type conversion operator doesn&#39;t work when invoked on a forwarding reference (works when object is passed by value)"}],"owner":{"reputation":15892,"user_id":634821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6d6c32f9917c7209b1bd9dfe888c293?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Violet Giraffe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/634821/violet-giraffe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46842,"user_id":6022656,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf138f6c424001ac8491ca86b1976c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"max66","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6022656/max66"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":105,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58138085,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1569600527,"creation_date":1569533546,"last_edit_date":1569571731,"question_id":58125039,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58125039","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t fathom the essence of this error so pardon me if the title could be better.

trick here is to understand that what you have on your files on the working tree, if you _try_ to checkout another branch, git will see if the modified file is the same (without your uncommitted

will accompany you on the switch. If, however, the modified file is _not_ the same between HEAD and where you want to go, git will refuse to checkout (unless you force, of course).

Now.... having said that, what part of the process you described makes you scratch your head? Is it the `git checkout -- newfile` part?

(In terms of the length of the string, how many is that?)\r\n\r\nA string that has a single `b` will end up looking the same when &quot;filled&quot; with `b`s as if it didn&#39;t have that `b` in it. So it&#39;s as if we started with a string 1 character shorter (the original `b` doesn&#39;t give us an extra position to insert them) and also we can insert 1 fewer `b` because the one that was already there will take its place. So as a result, we insert (exercise: how many?) fewer `b`s than if the character were not a `b`.\r\n\r\nThis extends to any number of isolated `b`s.\r\n\r\nIf there is a double `b`, then it removes two places to insert: compare inserting into `acbbca` to inserting in `acca`. Either way we get `bbabbcbbcbbabb`; the principle is the same - we start with a string 2 characters shorter and insert 2 fewer `b`s because they were already there. That is to say, it doesn&#39;t matter whether the original `b`s were isolated or doubled up; each `b` in the original string reduces the answer by the same amount.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a simple mathematical formula - in terms of the length of the string and the number of `b`s already present - tells us the answer. (Of course, if there is already a triple `b` then we cannot add to the string at all, so we should sanity-check for that separately).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125024/how-many-characters-x-can-you-add-in-a-string-so-that-no-three-consecutive-chara/58125103#58125103","title":"How many characters x can you add in a string so that no three consecutive characters exist within the string?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":29188,"user_id":3386109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zt9UL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3386109","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3386109/user3386109"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569544312,"post_id":58125119,"comment_id":102640490,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58125024/how-many-characters-x-can-you-add-in-a-string-so-that-no-three-consecutive-chara/58125119#comment102640490_58125119"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569544317,"last_edit_date":1569544317,"creation_date":1569534099,"answer_id":58125119,"question_id":58125024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125119","body_markdown":"As it turns out, one insight makes this trivial.

Updates: #\r\n\r\n - Optimised to only store the `id` field to the DataFrame.\r\n   - A DataFrame was kept (rather than a `list`) to aid in future expansion and flexibility.\r\n\r\n# Answer: #\r\n\r\nAfter working through (what I believe to be) your scenario, we have the following setup/requirements:\r\n\r\n - You have one jsonlines file called `output.jsonl`.\r\n - This `output.jsonl` file contains (n) dictionaries; one for each PDF parsed by PyPDF2.\r\n - We must loop through a directory of 400+ parsed PDF files and determine if that PDF&#39;s filename is in `output.jsonl`.\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, let&#39;s change tack and take the following approach:\r\n\r\n - Create a `list` of PDF filenames (called `pdfs`).\r\n - Read the `id` field from the jsonlines file (`output.jsonl`) into a `pandas.DataFrame` (called `df`).\r\n -  Loop through the `pdfs` list and test whether the filename (`id`) is in the DataFrame (`df`).\r\n - If not, add the filename to a list (called `notin`).\r\n - Do as you wish with the `notin` `list` to parse these new files into ... whatever you like.\r\n\r\nMy (extended) `output.jsonl` file looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;1234&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Transcript&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;www.stackoverflow.com&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;200 pages worth of text&quot;}\r\n

I am trying to recognize if that &quot;id&quot; is a value in the jsonlines file, then there is no need for PyPDF2 to convert it to text.

Instead it uses strings which can be problematic since they don&#39;t update dynamically. For example, if you create a new node `my_cube = cmds.polyCube(n=&#39;cube&#39;)[0]` then rename it, the `my_cube` variable will still be pointing the object&#39;s older name.\r\n\r\nThis could also be a problem if there are multiple objects in the scene that share the same duplicate name. Maya usually auto-renames duplicate naming to avoid conflicts, but it&#39;s valid to have duplicate names in different hierarchies. In this case you would have to access it by using the node&#39;s long name. For example, an object named `&quot;cube&quot;` that&#39;s parented under another object named `&quot;root&quot;` would have a long name `&quot;|root|cube&quot;`.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, yes, there is a problem with this code. It&#39;s making 2 cubes with the same name and re-parenting them to a different hierarchy. So there will be 2 nodes with the name `&quot;cube&quot;`. When the `select` command is called, it&#39;s literately calling `cmds.select(&quot;cube&quot;)`, but since there&#39;s more than one `&quot;cube&quot;` Maya has no idea how to interpret that and then throws an error.\r\n\r\nWhat *can* be done is to capture the object&#39;s new long name by doing this after it parents: `self.cube = cmds.ls(sl=True, long=True)[0]`\r\n\r\nNow it&#39;s able to select the first cube as expected.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124998/selecting-maya-objects-through-memory-using-classes/58126915#58126915","title":"Selecting Maya objects through memory

I&#39;ve copied the code (barring the query itself) from another application I wrote that works fine.

I&#39;m just not getting anything back.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve put in breakpoints and checked my connection and query, and it is what I expect.

If the *dynamism* refers to *frequently (once every few days) changing file-names*\r\n\r\nStore the name of file in an Airflow [`Variable`][1] (you seem to have already figured this out)\r\n\r\n - refer the name of file from Airflow Variable (rather than hard-coding in dag-definition file)\r\n - and when need arises, you can update the file-name (Variable) via WebUI itself\r\n\r\nB. If *dynamism* means *each task / dag-run must process a different file*, then here are the options\r\n\r\n 1. External system that is generating these JSON files can also update the above-mentioned Airflow Variable so that your tasks can pick the correct file-name. I personally don&#39;t like this approach since external system has to become Airflow-aware and also it appears to be error-prone\r\n\r\n 2. If possible, the external system and Airflow tasks should adhere to some **file-naming convention**, so that we don&#39;t even need to communicate the exact filename to task (task already knows how to determine the filename). For instance, you can have your file named as `{execution_date}-{dag_id}-{env}-{task_id}.json`. This approach is relatively good, but only as long as a templatized file-name fits into your system (which might not be the case)\r\n\r\n 3. The upstream task that gets hold of the exact filename, can convey this information to downstream task via [XCOM][2]. This approach is most robust of all\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for your query\r\n\r\n&gt; Does anyone have an idea how to get around the limitations of not\r\n&gt; being able to use Python functions in Airflow outside of\r\n&gt; PythonOperator and python_callable?\r\n\r\nI think solving this takes just some getting-used-to (and a bit of creativity) with Airflow framework. You can always subclass any Airflow Operator (including [`EmrCreateJobFlowOperator`][3]), and then override the [`pre_execute()`, `execute()`, &amp; `post_execute()` methods][4] and add your custom logic there\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSuggested reads\r\n\r\n - [EMR Cluster Creation using Airflow dag run, Once task is done EMR will be terminated][5]\r\n - [Airflow: Lesser Known Tips, Tricks, and Best Practises][6]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**EDIT-1**\r\n\r\n*responding to queries raised over comments*\r\n\r\n&gt; I could not get the job_flow_overrides to take an XCOM as input. Do\r\n&gt; you know how to remedy this?\r\n\r\nKnowing that [`job_flow_overrides`][7] is a [template field][8] of [`EmrCreateJobFlowOperator`][3] (the developers of `Airflow` had your use-case in mind), you can employ `JINJA` templating to [pull it][9] via [`XCOM`][10]\r\n\r\n\r\n    import json\r\n    my_dag = DAG(dag_id=&quot;my_dag&quot;,\r\n                 ..\r\n                 user_defined_macros={\r\n                     &#39;json&#39;: json\r\n                 }\r\n                 ..\r\n                 )\r\n    create_emr_task = EmrCreateJobFlowOperator(dag_id=&quot;my_dag&quot;,\r\n                                               task_id=&quot;create_emr_task&quot;,\r\n                                               ..\r\n                                               job_flow_overrides=&quot;{{ json.loads(ti.xcom_pull(task_ids=&#39;my_xcom_pusher_task&#39;)) }}&quot;\r\n                                               ..)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; do you have any examples for using/ overwriting the execute() methods?\r\n\r\nWell this now is a pure `python` question.

I&#39;ve noticed this started happening a lot more often when I reduced Postgres&#39; `max_connections` to `100` (down from `300`) so I suspect it could be related to something with the database.

to keystroke &quot;x&quot; using {command down}`, since there is no &quot;cut text&quot; command in the TexShop dictionary?\r\n\r\n- How can I tell AppleScript to write `subfile{etc.}` in exactly the place that I cut the text? How can I tell AppleScript to paste the text in exactly the part of the new file I want?\r\n\r\n**The basic idea:**\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Assuming the text is already cut (?):\r\n\r\n        tell application &quot;Finder&quot;/&quot;TexShop&quot; to set thisWord to get clipboard as text\r\n\r\n2. Or, somehow &quot;call&quot; CMD-X using AppleScript:\r\n\r\n        tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to keystroke &quot;x&quot; using {command down}\r\n\r\n3. Get the filename:\r\n\r\n        set response to display dialog &quot;Filename: &quot; default answer &quot;&quot;\r\n        set fileName to get text of response &amp; &quot;.tex&quot;`\r\n\r\n4. Get container path\r\n\r\n        tell application &quot;TexShop&quot; to set thePath to get path of document 1\r\n        tell application &quot;Finder&quot; to set parentPath to get container of thePath\r\n\r\n5. Write `&quot;\\subfile{&quot; &amp; parentPath &amp; fileName &amp; &quot;}&quot;` exactly where the text was cut from? How???\r\n\r\n6. Make new file:\r\n\r\n        tell application &quot;Finder&quot; to set newFile to &#172;\r\n        \tmake new file at parentPath with properties {name:fileName}\r\n\r\n7. Write to file:\r\n\r\n        set preamble to &quot;\r\n        \\documentclass{article}\r\n\r\n        \\begin{document}\r\n        \\begin{English}&quot;\r\n\r\n        &amp; thisWord &amp;\r\n\r\n        &quot;\\end{English}\r\n\r\n        \\begin{Swedish}\r\n\r\n        \\end{Swedish}\r\n\r\n        \\end{document}&quot;\r\n\r\n        set openFile to open newFile with write permission\r\n        write preamble to openFile\r\n\r\n8. Combining strings as above would be fine for me, but it would also be interesting to know how to write theWord to that specific place after I have already written the above.\r\n\r\nI know there are multiple questions in here, but if you can help me, I cannot express the appreciation I will have. This issue has been stumping me for too long, and I am just dying to know how to make such an automation functional.

like that you&#39;re *explicitly* referring to `ActiveSheet`, kudos!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `ActiveSheet` is an `Object`, wich means the compiler is helpless: `ActiveSheet.Shapes` compiles, but so will `ActiveSheet.Shapess` - even with `Option Explicit` specified. The entire expression is evaluated at run-time.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s fix that first:\r\n\r\n    Dim sheet As Worksheet\r\n    Set sheet = ActiveSheet\r\n\r\nNow `sheet.Shapes` gets intellisense and compile-time validation, along with subsequent the `.AddShape` member call. You even get parameter tooltips as you type up the argument list!\r\n\r\nWhat happens next is interesting: you declared `MyShape` as a `Shape`, but it&#39;s not a `Shape` you&#39;re looking at - the `Shape` class doesn&#39;t have a `ShapeRange` property, so... where does `MyShape.ShapeRange` come from then?\r\n\r\nIf you break execution (F9 to set a breakpoint) after the `MyShape.Select` call, and then bring up the *immediate pane* (Ctrl+G), the answer appears:\r\n\r\n    ?typename(selection)\r\n    Rectangle\r\n\r\nIf you press Shift+F2 on the word `Rectangle`...\r\n\r\n    Dim myRectangle As Excel.Rectangle &#39;&lt;~ here\r\n\r\n...the VBE doesn&#39;t seem to figure it out (&quot;identifier under cursor is not recognized&quot;). So we press F2, then right-click somewhere and tick the &quot;Show hidden members&quot; option - and sure enough, there it is:\r\n\r\n![Rectangle.ShapeRange in the VBE&#39;s Object Browser][1]\r\n\r\nSo your code says &quot;let&#39;s use the `Shape` interface&quot;, but works with a `Rectangle` object. And since that works, it means a `Rectangle` &quot;is a&quot; `Shape`: the two interfaces simply describe the same object through different lens, so either works... but then `Shape.ShapeRange` doesn&#39;t look quite right, since the `Shape` class doesn&#39;t define that member *and that&#39;s the interface we explicitly said we were going to be working with*.\r\n\r\nIf we want to invoke the members of `Rectangle`, we can - and since we&#39;re now showing hidden members in the object browser, intellisense displays the hidden types and members too. If the entire `With` block is early-bound, everything makes much more sense:\r\n\r\n    With myRectangle.ShapeRange.Fill\r\n\r\n...and explains how the late-bound code off `ActiveSheet` would work at run-time to resolve the member call, and now the compiler needs a completely other strategy to compile the VBA code: *maybe* that could shake things up enough to get it to work, maybe it won&#39;t. At least the type ambiguities and ignored-by-compiler statements are all gone :)\r\n\r\nThe thing that&#39;s surprising here, is that you can&#39;t do that with VBA user code. If you made a `MyShape` class with a `DoSomething` method:\r\n\r\n    &#39;@ModuleDescription &quot;A metaphorical Shape&quot;\r\n    Option Explicit\r\n    \r\n    Public Sub DoSomething()\r\n        MsgBox TypeName(Me)\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAnd then a `MyRectangle` class that implements `MyShape` and exposes a member on its own public interface, that yields a `MyShape` object reference:\r\n\r\n    &#39;@ModuleDescription &quot;A metaphorical Rectangle&quot;\r\n    Option Explicit\r\n    Private sh As MyShape\r\n    Implements MyShape\r\n    \r\n    Public Property Get Thing() As Object\r\n        Set Thing = sh\r\n    End Property\r\n    \r\n    Private Sub Class_Initialize()\r\n        Set sh = New MyShape\r\n    End Sub\r\n    \r\n    Private Sub MyShape_DoSomething()\r\n        MsgBox TypeName(Me)\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAnd now in any standard module, we can test this - first, all early-bound, and we&#39;ll have a factory method that returns a `MyShape`, to mimick `Shapes.CreateShape`:\r\n\r\n    Public Sub WorksMaybe()\r\n        Dim r As MyShape\r\n        Set r = CreateRect\r\n        r.Thing.DoSomething\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n    Private Function CreateRect() As MyShape\r\n        Set CreateRect = New MyRectangle\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\nSo we run this (on Windows), and I expected, the code doesn&#39;t compile:\r\n\r\n![Compile error: method of data member not found][2]\r\n\r\nLate binding however...\r\n\r\n    Public Sub WorksMaybe()\r\n        Dim r As Object\r\n        Set r = CreateRect\r\n        r.Thing.DoSomething\r\n    End Sub\r\n    \r\n    Private Function CreateRect() As MyShape\r\n        Set CreateRect = New MyRectangle\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\n...works? Nope:\r\n\r\n![run-time error 438: &quot;object doesn&#39;t support this property or method&quot;][3]\r\n\r\nAre we not looking at a `MyRectangle` object? No: we&#39;re looking at the limits of *late-binding polymorphism* in VBA - we created a `New MyRectangle`, but to the compiler `CreateRect` returns a `MyShape` object reference. If we place a breakpoint on `End Function`, run it, and then type `?TypeName(CreateRect)` in the immediate pane (Ctrl+G) when the breakpoint is hit, then despite the *declared type* being `MyShape`, the *runtime type* is clearly `MyRectangle`.\r\n\r\n*And it **should** work* - but it doesn&#39;t. Error 438, member not found: the late-bound/run-time equivalent of the &quot;method or data member not found&quot; compile error.\r\n\r\nAnd if we use the interface we really mean to work with...\r\n\r\n    Public Sub WorksMaybe()\r\n        Dim r As MyRectangle\r\n        Set r = CreateRect\r\n        r.Thing.DoSomething\r\n    End Sub\r\n    \r\n    Private Function CreateRect() As MyShape\r\n        Set CreateRect = New MyRectangle\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\n...then everything &quot;just works&quot;:\r\n\r\n![&quot;MyShape&quot; message box in front of a giant blue shape on a worksheet][4]\r\n\r\nNow, I&#39;m not running this on a Mac, but this code compiles for me...\r\n\r\n    Option Explicit\r\n    Const DistanceBetweenCells As Long = 50\r\n    Const LineWidth As Long = 2\r\n\r\n    Public Sub WorksMaybe()\r\n        Dim r As Excel.Rectangle\r\n        Set r = CreateRect\r\n        r.ShapeRange.Fill.BackColor.RGB = vbRed\r\n    End Sub\r\n    \r\n    Private Function CreateRect() As Excel.Shape\r\n        Set CreateRect = Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 40, 40, DistanceBetweenCells, LineWidth)\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\n...and systematically raises run-time error 13 as soon as `CreateRect` returns and the `Shape` reference gets assigned to a `Rectangle` - error 13 being &quot;type mismatch&quot;. In other words, a `Rectangle` is *not* a `Shape` (!!?!??). Proof, if we make `CreateRect` return a `Excel.Rectangle`, we now get the type mismatch error as soon as we try to assign the function&#39;s return value, and nothing makes sense anymore: there&#39;s something weird going on, and, well, I&#39;m out of ideas - there doesn&#39;t appear to be any way to work early-bound with a `Rectangle`, despite what `TypeName(Selection)` claims the type is (the class is hidden/undocumented for a reason after all!), which... pretty much destroys all hope, especially if neither `With Selection.Fill` nor `With MyShape.Fill` work (it does work perfectly fine here on my Windows box though).\r\n\r\nSending a frown with some repro code through the user feedback feature should get you heard from the product team at Microsoft. I doubt they removed anything from anywhere - but it&#39;s not impossible something broke how interfaces are resolved, somewhere deep down in some seemingly unrelated piece of internal API :)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QC0zq.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GxcEM.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0FDP.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wwhkv.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124950/latest-excel-for-mac-no-longer-compiles/58125095#58125095","title":"Latest Excel for Mac no longer compiles"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53116,"user_id":1188513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mathieu Guindon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1188513/mathieu-guindon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569554927,"post_id":58126448,"comment_id":102642411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124950/latest-excel-for-mac-no-longer-compiles/58126448#comment102642411_58126448"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2850281,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee4aa2470da3f5346a628ca5e5ddb26f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Swannekin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2850281/swannekin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53116,"user_id":1188513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mathieu Guindon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1188513/mathieu-guindon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569602370,"post_id":58126448,"comment_id":102663403,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124950/latest-excel-for-mac-no-longer-compiles/58126448#comment102663403_58126448"},{"owner":{"reputation":53116,"user_id":1188513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mathieu Guindon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1188513/mathieu-guindon"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569602732,"post_id":58126448,"comment_id":102663564,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124950/latest-excel-for-mac-no-longer-compiles/58126448#comment102663564_58126448"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2850281,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee4aa2470da3f5346a628ca5e5ddb26f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Swannekin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2850281/swannekin"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569545824,"creation_date":1569545824,"answer_id":58126448,"question_id":58124950,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126448","body_markdown":"Ok, I think it is figured out.

Unfortunately, compiler won&#39;t allow this.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to provide an abstract class like that?\r\n\r\nWhat I think is to provide an abstract of state machine, the logic of how to run the state machine doesn&#39;t need to change for a set of problems, like taking the input and moving on to the next state, etc. But this abstraction doesn&#39;t care how state and input are defined, maybe something like below.\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate&lt;S, I&gt;\r\nclass StateMachine\r\n{\r\n  public:\r\n    void set_initial_state(const S &amp;is)\r\n    {\r\n        current_state = is;\r\n    }\r\n    void take_input(const I &amp;input)\r\n    {\r\n        S next_state = current_state.transit(input);\r\n        current_state = next_state;\r\n    }\r\n  private:\r\n    S current_state;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nWhen using this template, I would like to provide more hint to &quot;S&quot;. For example, it must have a &quot;transit&quot; function. That&#39;s what I come for the idea of abstract class of &quot;State&quot;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124923/c-how-to-write-this-abstract-class","title":"C++: how to write this abstract class?"},{"tags":["python","django","amazon-s3"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":354,"user_id":7366513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Iow9prwkTdY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANQ/yz9a_DXVX5c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mirza715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7366513/mirza715"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569542234,"post_id":58124921,"comment_id":102640157,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124921/how-to-update-filefield-filename-after-its-saved-in-django-and-using-s3-as-the#comment102640157_58124921"},{"owner":{"reputation":732,"user_id":2096808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9c0b94f9f60e916d4e4422710551638?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jerry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2096808/jerry"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":354,"user_id":7366513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Iow9prwkTdY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANQ/yz9a_DXVX5c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mirza715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7366513/mirza715"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569591035,"post_id":58124921,"comment_id":102657825,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124921/how-to-update-filefield-filename-after-its-saved-in-django-and-using-s3-as-the#comment102657825_58124921"}],"owner":{"reputation":732,"user_id":2096808,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9c0b94f9f60e916d4e4422710551638?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jerry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2096808/jerry"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569532862,"creation_date":1569532862,"question_id":58124921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124921","body_markdown":"I have a model that has a FileField.

Also it stores session cookie against which Ruby on Rails will compare csrf-token:\r\n&gt; HMTrRjbvbeFLTlkv8rpGLZhPWOHk1PCgSKCzbuhPMOjvrNlR0uQo7LqD47qGvQ8/T+/HMzvEq5sMoaNiJF94+g==\r\n\r\nThen it makes request with this token and secured http only cookies:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreq.open(&#39;POST&#39;, &#39;http://attacked-website.com/fakes&#39;, false);\r\nreq.setRequestHeader(&#39;X-CSRF-Token&#39;, token)\r\nreq.withCredentials = true;\r\nreq.send(null);\r\n```\r\nAnd ... xsrf protection passes!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOk, i&#39;ve cheated. In reality it doesn&#39;t. It passes only if i&#39;ve executed this code for example from console from same site. And if code executes on another website then i got:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP Origin header (http://fishing-website.com) didn&#39;t match request.base_url (http://attacked-website.com)\r\nCompleted 422 Unprocessable Entity in 1ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 485)\r\n  \r\nActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken):\r\n  \r\nactionpack (6.0.0) lib/action_controller/metal/request_forgery_protection.rb:217:in `handle_unverified_request&#39;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut wait isn&#39;t a CORS protection designed for this?

It&#39;s technically working, but I feel like I&#39;m probably handling it wrong by making `then` synchronous.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124910/async-await-inside-of-promise-then","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Async/await inside of Promise then"},{"tags":["android","build.gradle"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10952276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BgISp6dgx8w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/hYOib7ncMKw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeff Hatfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10952276/jeff-hatfield"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569535177,"post_id":58125026,"comment_id":102638828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124909/error-gradle-dsl-method-not-found-for-custom-method/58125026#comment102638828_58125026"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10952276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BgISp6dgx8w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/hYOib7ncMKw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeff Hatfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10952276/jeff-hatfield"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569536435,"post_id":58125026,"comment_id":102639132,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124909/error-gradle-dsl-method-not-found-for-custom-method/58125026#comment102639132_58125026"},{"owner":{"reputation":412,"user_id":1300813,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IteN0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mayuri Khinvasara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1300813/mayuri-khinvasara"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10952276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BgISp6dgx8w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/hYOib7ncMKw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeff Hatfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10952276/jeff-hatfield"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569557151,"post_id":58125026,"comment_id":102642808,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124909/error-gradle-dsl-method-not-found-for-custom-method/58125026#comment102642808_58125026"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":412,"user_id":1300813,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IteN0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mayuri Khinvasara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1300813/mayuri-khinvasara"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569533472,"creation_date":1569533472,"answer_id":58125026,"question_id":58124909,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125026","body_markdown":"The custom method &quot;getGitHash()&quot; defined in gradle is only available in this gradle file.\r\nPlease check if you calling it from somewhere outside.\r\nAlso you need to define the method before you use it, i.e place it above in your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124909/error-gradle-dsl-method-not-found-for-custom-method/58125026#58125026","title":"ERROR: Gradle DSL method not found for custom method"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10952276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BgISp6dgx8w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/hYOib7ncMKw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeff Hatfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10952276/jeff-hatfield"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569536406,"creation_date":1569536406,"answer_id":58125441,"question_id":58124909,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125441","body_markdown":"The problem is that the definitions for the methods `getGitHash` and `getGitBranch` are WITHIN the `android` section of the build.gradle file.
