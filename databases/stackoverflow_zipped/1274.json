I found out that the loginWithCredentials method returns a Promise&lt;StitchUser&gt;. \r\n\r\nHowever, NgRx Effects require us to build an Observable chain, so I tried converting the returned Promise to an Observable using the from() method from rxjs but I&#39;m getting an error and I haven&#39;t been able to find a way around it.

The StitchUser type is a JS object with fields such as the userid (string), the user profile (another JS object with email and other stuff), and other key: value pairs generated by Stitch.\r\n\r\nEven before compiling the code I get an error in my IDE (VS Code) with also appears when I try compile my app:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror TS2345: Argument of type &#39;(authData: LoginStart) =&gt; void&#39; is not assignable to parameter of type &#39;(value: LoginStart, index: number) =&gt; ObservableInput&lt;any&gt;&#39;.\r\n[ng]       Type &#39;void&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;ObservableInput&lt;any&gt;&#39;.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas?

want to write my own SQL scalar function that calculates the mean between data points of a single column over a variable number of rows, based on a second column.

Not sure if any of these will help anyone in the future or not but here is what I did. I ended up rolling back the version of wordpress to before gutenburg using a rollback plugin, installed duplicator backed up and exported the database, I then disabled the rollback back to the latest version of wordpress, I installed a plugin that wasn&#39;t enabled previously called &quot;UpSolution Core&quot; through the &quot;zephyr&quot; theme menu. That never finished installing. I got an error stating I needed to disable wordfence to continue with the update. At this point the site returned to normal (before I disabled wordfence). But I continued with the installation by disabling wordfence, finishing the plugin install, then updating zephyr theme files it recommended after the install and re-enabled wordfence. \r\n\r\nSo oddly enough somewhere in the middle there it fixed the site.

I have all the locations of the castles in an array at the moment and have some javascript although it isnt showing anything. \r\n\r\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; castles.length; i++ ) {\r\n      var addMarker = (&quot;The lat is &quot; + castles[i][1]+&quot; and the long is &quot;+ castles[i][2]);\r\n      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({\r\n        position: {lat: castles[1], lng: castles[2]},\r\n        map: map\r\n      });\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239244/using-buttons-to-show-correlating-location-map-markers-on-a-map","title":"Using buttons to show correlating location map markers on a map"},{"tags":["c#","dotnetbrowser"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":2603324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a93d42592bde5c2a776a1107fc5db43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Heopas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2603324/heopas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571213802,"post_id":58396498,"comment_id":103161264,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239242/dotnetbrowser-check-if-element-is-visible/58396498#comment103161264_58396498"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11394940,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLLL7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roman Vasylenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11394940/roman-vasylenko"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571148069,"creation_date":1571148069,"answer_id":58396498,"question_id":58239242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396498","body_markdown":"Regarding obtaining the javascript function, please consider separating the function definition and returning it to the C# side.

I put it back this morning but to no avail - still the click listener did not work. However, armed with the knowledge that it was the correct code I went searching the Internet once again and found a ListView example at https://android--code.blogspot.com/2018/02/android-kotlin-listview-example.html\r\n\r\nI created a new project and copied in the code - it worked perfectly and so I was at least moving forward with working code.\r\n\r\nI could not see any significant differences in my code to the one I downloaded and so to make sure I copied the xml and kt code into the activity as a total replacement to the code I had written.  This time it did not work.  Thinking that it must be something to do with the linking of the activities, I started from first principles and did the same with the main activity.  This way, the main activity of the working example and that of the programme I am creating are identical.  Still it did not work !!\r\n\r\nThe problem was therefore nothing to do with the code as it is identical between the two projects.  I started searching deeper.  First made the two Gradle file and the Manifest file the same and deleted off all the other activities I had created....... still not working!\r\n\r\nFinally looked at the last option - Styles and, yipee, I finally managed to trace the cause of the problem.  I had accidentally set the TextView style parent to Widget.AppCompat.AutoCompleteTextView instead of android:Widget.TextView.\r\n\r\nSo, I loaded the backup of the programme and corrected this mistake and it is now working properly.  I have absolutely no idea why a different style for the colour scheme should block the operation of the on-click listener but I presume that the AutoCompleteTextView style has it&#39;s own listener that took priority.\r\n\r\nOnce again, many thanks for your help\r\n\r\neggie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239224/kotlin-simple-list-item-1-onclicklistener-not-working/58248057#58248057","title":"kotlin simple_list_item_1 onclicklistener not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12158747,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Wb9fvGrdmJo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc0VYbCqORJXoBsSzdoDQJj_SGnBg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"eggie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12158747/eggie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":689,"user_id":11351392,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33b7a69ff8d14960b71442fb76a469a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lotor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11351392/lotor"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570276574,"creation_date":1570202492,"last_edit_date":1570213989,"question_id":58239224,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239224","body_markdown":"I am building a shopping list App and this is one of the activities.\r\n\r\nBasically the activity takes a database of all locations around the house and extracts a list of the names to create an arrayList of Strings for display.\r\n\r\nAfter that it binds the prepareListView to a variable prepareList and creates an arrayAdapter with a layout of simple_list_item_1.\r\n\r\nAfter attaching the adapter it sets the onItemClicListener.\r\n\r\nThe Listview works perfectly but I cannot get the onClickListener to work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have searched this site and also generally on the internet without finding a solution.

I believe this is only in [`Toolbar`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v4.5.0/packages/material-ui/src/Toolbar/Toolbar.js#L23). It is also used in several demos of other components such as `Drawer`, but I think `Toolbar` is the only place in the library itself that uses it.\r\n\r\nYou can also look at the source code for the [mixin itself](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v4.5.0/packages/material-ui/src/styles/createMixins.js#L32) which looks like the following:\r\n```\r\n    toolbar: {\r\n      minHeight: 56,\r\n      [`${breakpoints.up(&#39;xs&#39;)} and (orientation: landscape)`]: {\r\n        minHeight: 48,\r\n      },\r\n      [breakpoints.up(&#39;sm&#39;)]: {\r\n        minHeight: 64,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n```\r\nThe [Responsive drawer demo](https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/#responsive-drawer) is one demo that uses the mixin in a couple places. The source code for the demo can be seen here: https://codesandbox.io/s/v66pl.\r\n\r\nYou can look at the styles in the `&lt;head&gt;` element within that demo and find what gets generated for `MuiToolbar`. Specifically, its `regular` class is the one that uses the mixin.\r\n\r\nHere is the generated CSS:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.MuiToolbar-regular {\r\n  min-height: 56px;\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width:0px) and (orientation: landscape) {\r\n  .MuiToolbar-regular {\r\n    min-height: 48px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width:600px) {\r\n  .MuiToolbar-regular {\r\n    min-height: 64px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo leverage this CSS without using the theme, just copy this CSS into your SCSS file with a different class name:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.plain-css-mui-toolbar-mixin {\r\n  min-height: 56px;\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width: 0px) and (orientation: landscape) {\r\n  .plain-css-mui-toolbar-mixin {\r\n    min-height: 48px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\r\n  .plain-css-mui-toolbar-mixin {\r\n    min-height: 64px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use this in the appropriate places.

When a class `B` object is sent via Jackson, I want to send only some values of the class `A` like objects, but not the class `A` objects themselves.\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\npublic class B {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    @JsonIgnore\r\n    private A instanceA;\r\n\r\n    public String getValue() {\r\n        return instanceA.getValue();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setValue(String value) {\r\n        instanceA.setValue(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy Spring controller looks like this.\r\n```java\r\n@Controller\r\npublic class AppController {\r\n\r\n    @RequestMapping(value = &quot;/receive&quot;,\r\n            consumes = { &quot;application/json&quot; },\r\n            method = RequestMethod.POST)\r\n    public void receiveB(@RequestBody B instanceB) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Value: &quot; + instanceB.getValue());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn deserialization Jackson is currently trying to instantiate an object without Spring. Therefore the autowired `instanceA` in class `B` is null and when Jackson tries to set the value in class `B`, it gives following response message (`400`):\r\n```\r\nJSON parse error: null; nested exception is com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: N/A\\n at [Source: (PushbackInputStream); line: 2, column: 27] (through reference chain: B[\\&quot;value\\&quot;])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I want Jackson to get a class `B` bean from Spring and paste the received data into it. Is there any deserialization setting or annotation to achieve that?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239213/how-to-inject-beans-when-jackson-deserializes-a-json-request","title":"How to inject beans when Jackson deserializes a JSON request?"},{"tags":["google-chrome","cmd","prompt"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":402,"user_id":7841556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9JBz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7841556/vishal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202490,"post_id":58239210,"comment_id":102850989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239210/google-chrome-what-is-this-prompt#comment102850989_58239210"},{"owner":{"reputation":443,"user_id":655947,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f3099fd1a16252881ef1246f3dbe84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"level42","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/655947/level42"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202579,"post_id":58239210,"comment_id":102851022,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239210/google-chrome-what-is-this-prompt#comment102851022_58239210"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11005871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-60UNlf-wExU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABkY/AkTomVWsjzU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Simone Termine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11005871/simone-termine"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11005871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-60UNlf-wExU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABkY/AkTomVWsjzU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Simone Termine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11005871/simone-termine"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570202501,"creation_date":1570202419,"last_edit_date":1570202501,"question_id":58239210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239210","body_markdown":"does anyone know what this prompt is?

I&#39;m not the owner of everything running in the cluster, but I do know istio was introduced somewhat recently (previously using nginx-ingress).\r\n\r\nI have a REST API application deployed on the cluster with a particular route that returns about 7MB worth of historical data (as a json structure). The API application caches the data using a python module to avoid any overhead from the DB (helm-mysql) queries or data processing.  A web application (also deployed in the cluster) fetches the data from the API for display, but by using curl directly I&#39;ve **narrowed the problem to either the API app or networking**. Further narrowing the problem scope, I am able to consistently get the data successfully when running curl in the container (docker exec bash and executing curl on localhost). \r\n\r\nExample of running curl within the container:\r\n\r\n    # time curl -o /dev/null localhost/$ROUTE?numDays=30\r\n      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n    100 6380k  100 6380k    0     0  2716k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:-- 2716k\r\n\r\n    real    0m2.359s\r\n    user    0m0.007s\r\n    sys     0m0.012s\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when using the ingress or the cluster-ip to access the API application, which intermittently **takes more than 2 min to complete**. The failure occurs more than 50% of the time.\r\n\r\n    $ time curl -o /dev/null $CLUSTER_IP/$ROUTE?numDays=30\r\n      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n    100 6380k  100 6380k    0     0  51523      0  0:02:06  0:02:06 --:--:--  331k\r\n\r\n    real    2m6.810s\r\n    user    0m0.011s\r\n    sys     0m0.038s\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these examples of the response taking 2 min, they originally send a **partial amount of the data**.. then after 2 min we get 100%. (Below output shows 81% data after a few seconds have elapsed)\r\n\r\n    $ time curl -o /dev/null $CLUSTER_IP/$ROUTE?numDays=30\r\n      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n     81 6380k   81 5178k    0     0   988k      0  0:00:06  0:00:05  0:00:01 1222k\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking for any help or suggestions on how to proceed with debugging the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cluster information:\r\n\r\nKubernetes version:\r\n\r\n    $ kubectl version\r\n    Client Version: version.Info{Major:&quot;1&quot;, Minor:&quot;14&quot;, GitVersion:&quot;v1.14.3&quot;,    GitCommit:&quot;5e53fd6bc17c0dec8434817e69b04a25d8ae0ff0&quot;, GitTreeState:&quot;clean&quot;, BuildDate:&quot;2019-06-06T01:44:30Z&quot;, GoVersion:&quot;go1.12.5&quot;, Compiler:&quot;gc&quot;, Platform:&quot;linux/amd64&quot;}\r\n    Server Version: version.Info{Major:&quot;1&quot;, Minor:&quot;14&quot;, GitVersion:&quot;v1.14.3&quot;, GitCommit:&quot;5e53fd6bc17c0dec8434817e69b04a25d8ae0ff0&quot;, GitTreeState:&quot;clean&quot;, BuildDate:&quot;2019-06-06T01:36:19Z&quot;, GoVersion:&quot;go1.12.5&quot;, Compiler:&quot;gc&quot;, Platform:&quot;linux/amd64&quot;}\r\n\r\n - Cloud being used: bare-metal\r\n - Installation method: unknown (possibly relevant metallb-system)\r\n - Host OS: RHEL7.5\r\n - CNI and version: calico/cni:v3.8.0\r\n - CRI and version: Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAdditional detail to answer comments:\r\n\r\nA work-around was in place to reduce the amount of data for 30days from ~7MB to ~3MB. Additional changes were made to reduce the data further by changing the default from 30 days to 14 days (further reducing data to ~1.5MB). This worked for a while, until strangely one of the other independent applications in the cluster was upgraded, let’s call it APP2. I do not own APP2, I know it was upgraded from release notes and can see the AGE in the get pods output.\r\n \r\nPlease correct me if I’m wrong: \r\n\r\n - POD_IP is a 192.   (found from the pod describe)\r\n - CLUSTER_IP is a 10.  (found via the service)\r\n - INGRESS is a 10. IP that istio binds to.\r\n\r\nRunning from a node within the cluster (POD is running on a separate node), the CLUSTER_IP and POD_IP both respond consistently, but the INGRESS hits the issue.\r\nRunning on some VM external to the cluster, the CLUSTER_IP and INGRESS both hit the issue (POD_IP not possible externally).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when a curl to the CLUSTER_IP on an external host is stuck.. I can successfully run internal curls using the POD and CLUSTER_IP.\r\n\r\nThe get pods output is pretty long. A summary: all pods related to MYAPP are running. There are a few istio-telemetry pods that are Evicted. There also appears to be one APP2 pod stuck in Terminating with over 2k restarts.\r\n\r\nThere is one endpoint registered to the service (one IP address under subsets-&gt;addresses-&gt;ip) and there is 1 POD serving the data.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239199/kubernetes-intermittent-delay-in-response-data-from-rest-application","title":"Kubernetes Intermittent Delay in response data from REST application"},{"tags":["visual-studio","solution-explorer"],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":2367094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d4cf54f6d4b0b23f48a3877f37d309?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jens Mander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2367094/jens-mander"},"last_editor":{"reputation":116,"user_id":2367094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63d4cf54f6d4b0b23f48a3877f37d309?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jens Mander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2367094/jens-mander"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570202965,"creation_date":1570202372,"last_edit_date":1570202965,"question_id":58239196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239196","body_markdown":"In Solution Explorer of Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 I&#39;ve got a dependencies section with four subsections labelled\r\n\r\n* Analyzers\r\n* Assemblies\r\n* NuGet\r\n* SDK\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand, what these subsections mean.

The problem is this line:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nh_a = std::make_unique&lt;A&gt; (A(x, y));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis constructs an unique pointer to an `A` from the given argument(s), `A(x, y)`. IOW, you are constructing an `A` from *an already constructed* instance of an `A`. This second instance is move-constructed from the first, and so takes over the first&#39;s instance of `B`, which now has a wrong pointer to its owning instance.\r\n\r\nYou can see this if you modify your code to print the identities of `A` and `B` as you are doing things to them:\r\n```\r\nCreating instance of H\r\n...creating instance of A (0x7ffecd5a6d40)... \r\n:- Creating instance of B (0x7ffecd5a6cf0) within A (0x7ffecd5a6d40)...\r\n:- ...B&#39;s y is set to 10\r\n:- ...B belongs to an A with value 2\r\n...A&#39;s x is set to 2\r\nUpdating A (0x19852a0)...

What you really need to do is either provide a move constructor for `A` that updates the owned instance of `B` to have the correct pointer, or at least explicitly delete the move constructor so that you can&#39;t accidentally misuse the class.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239158/nested-classs-raw-pointer-class-member-fails-to-return-assigned-pointed-to-obje/58239520#58239520","title":"Nested class&#39;s raw pointer class member fails to return assigned pointed-to-object&#39;s data"}],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":9084289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03d21cf7d4079d226bdd4e00c255c075?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user_15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9084289/user-15"},"last_editor":{"reputation":54,"user_id":9084289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03d21cf7d4079d226bdd4e00c255c075?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user_15","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9084289/user-15"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58239520,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570203562,"creation_date":1570202208,"last_edit_date":1570202658,"question_id":58239158,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239158","body_markdown":"I have a holder class ```H``` with a ```unique_ptr``` to an instance of class ```A``` (```H``` is the owner of ```A```).

As per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35843921/does-jmeter-pool-http-connections.\r\n\r\nIts clear that the default value is 2000 milliseconds as per httpclient4.time_to_live property in jmeter.properties\r\n\r\n    # TTL (in Milliseconds) represents an absolute value.\r\n    # No matter what, the connection will not be re-used beyond its TTL.\r\n    #httpclient4.time_to_live=2000\r\n\r\nVersion of jmeter:\r\n4.0.0 which uses Http4 client implementation\r\n\r\nThis means Jmeter creates connections for each thread which times out in 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nThe receiving jetty web server has following connection pool  values:\r\n\r\n    maxThreads = 3200\r\n    minthread = 656\r\n    idleTimeout = 60000\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the drop in hits per second from jmeter is induced due to the slow / no response from jetty server.? Are there any rules around matching the Jmeter thread count with the target web server&#39;s connection pool. ?\r\n\r\nNote: I understand that the throughput generally depends on the response from the Application Under Test.

you are trying to accomplish here is not possible the exact same way you are architecting this.\r\n\r\nIn the common, you cannot have platform specific implementations. In the common, you can add the code that is platform agnostic. The `FusedLocationProviderClient` is android specific. So, that dependencies you have with \r\n\r\n    implementation (&quot;com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0&quot;)\r\n\r\nmust be placed for the android&#39;s dependencies block. And if you need android specific dependencies, you will need android SDK, and `android {}` block in your gradle file as well. Something like this:\r\n\r\n    android {\r\n        compileSdkVersion(29)\r\n        defaultConfig {\r\n            minSdkVersion(21)\r\n            targetSdkVersion(29)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then in `kotlin{}` block, you can have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkotlin {\r\n...\r\n    sourceSets {\r\n        val androidMain by getting {\r\n            dependencies {\r\n                ...\r\n                implementation (&quot;com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0&quot;)\r\n                ...\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, note that you might need `AndroidManifest.xml` in `src/main` to define the packge. Something like\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n          package=&quot;com.example.packageName&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239119/kotlin-native-androidmain-unresolved-symbol/58312366#58312366","title":"Kotlin/Native -&gt; androidMain -&gt; Unresolved symbol"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5638854,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7386506d61865cad9f7d197d65358093?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Safiul Azam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5638854/safiul-azam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":864,"user_id":5446276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKM0T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5446276/john"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570655472,"creation_date":1570202062,"last_edit_date":1570212133,"question_id":58239119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239119","body_markdown":"I have added this line in common gradle.\r\n\r\n    implementation (&quot;com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0&quot;)\r\n\r\nI&#39;m tring to instantiate `FusedLocationProviderClient` inside a class in `androidMain`.\r\n\r\nBut it says, `unresolved symbol`.

can create a decodable struct that you will use to wrap your input and output into.\r\n\r\nThis will look like:\r\n```swift\r\nstruct ResponseContainer&lt;Input: Decodable, Output: Decodable&gt;: Decodable {\r\n    var status: String\r\n    var messages: [String]\r\n    var input: Input?\r\n    var output: Output\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this, if you want to decode a single Recipe, you just wrap your `Recipe` struct using into the response container:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// used to decode the `input`\r\nstruct InputId: Decodable {\r\n    var id: Int\r\n}\r\n\r\n// content of the `output`\r\nstruct Recipe: Decodable {\r\n    var id: Int\r\n    var title: String\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry? JSONDecoder().decode(ResponseContainer&lt;InputId, Recipe&gt;.self, from: singleRecipeJson)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to decode a list of recipes, just go the same way with another struct or an array:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// As the input is expected to be null, you can use a dummy struct in the wrapper.\r\nstruct Empty: Decodable {}\r\n\r\ntry! JSONDecoder().decode(ResponseContainer&lt;Empty, [Recipe]&gt;.self, from: multipleRecipeJson)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** The dummy struct `Empty` might not be useful as it add a lot of complexity, and is used to parse the `input` property of the payload, which look like something you sent to the API (so basically you already know it, and it can be ignored). In that case, the wrapper would look like that:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nstruct ResponseContainer&lt;Output: Decodable&gt;: Decodable {\r\n    var status: String\r\n    var messages: [String]\r\n    var output: Output\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239099/decoding-json-response-with-same-envelope-but-different-content/58239461#58239461","title":"Decoding JSON Response with same envelope but different content"}],"owner":{"reputation":1616,"user_id":265277,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9694ea7002bd54a8d1163caeb3593aa5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cnkt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/265277/cnkt"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58239461,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570203296,"creation_date":1570202013,"question_id":58239099,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239099","body_markdown":"I am accessing a web api and as response it sends different payloads wrapped in same envelope like that:\r\n\r\nGet a list of recipes:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;SUCCESS&quot;,\r\n        &quot;messages&quot;: [],\r\n        &quot;input&quot;: null,\r\n        &quot;output&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Egg with bacon&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Ice cream&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nGet a single recipe:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;SUCCESS&quot;,\r\n        &quot;messages&quot;: [],\r\n        &quot;input&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: 1},\r\n        &quot;output&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n            &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Egg with bacon&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAn error response:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;ERROR&quot;,\r\n        &quot;messages&quot;: [&quot;Recipe not found&quot;],\r\n        &quot;input&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: 4},\r\n        &quot;output&quot;: null\r\n    }\r\n\r\nList of categories:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;SUCCESS&quot;,\r\n        &quot;messages&quot;: [],\r\n        &quot;input&quot;: null,\r\n        &quot;output&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Deserts&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: 2,\r\n                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Main Courses&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, envelope keys are always present.

How to avoid this being recreated in the background?\r\n \r\n\r\nCList page codes.\r\n```\r\nclass _CListPageState extends State&lt;CListPage&gt; with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {\r\n  Widget _form;\r\n  CListApiBloc clistApiBLoC;\r\n  CListRepository _repo;\r\n  ScrollController _scrollController = new ScrollController();\r\n  @override\r\n  void initState() {\r\n    _repo = new CListRepository();\r\n    clistApiBLoC = new CListApiBloc(_repo);\r\n    super.initState();\r\n  }\r\n  @override\r\n  void dispose() {    \r\n    super.dispose();\r\n  }\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n\r\n    if(_form==null){\r\n      _form = _createForm(context);\r\n    } \r\n    return _form;\r\n  }\r\n  Widget _createForm(BuildContext context) {\r\n    final _scaffoldKey = new GlobalKey&lt;ScaffoldState&gt;();\r\n\t  return BlocProviderTree(\r\n        blocProviders: [          \r\n          BlocProvider&lt;CListApiBloc&gt;(\r\n            bloc: clistApiBLoC,\r\n          ),\r\n    ],\r\n    cList: Scaffold(      \r\n      key: _scaffoldKey,\r\n      resizeToAvoidBottomInset: true,\r\n      resizeToAvoidBottomPadding: false,\r\n      backgroundColor: pagebackgroundColor,\r\n      appBar: appBar(),\r\n      drawer: Theme(\r\n          data: Theme.of(context).copyWith(canvasColor: Colors.white),\r\n          cList: new ReusableWidgets().getDrawer(&#39;C List&#39;,context)\r\n      ),\r\n        body: SafeArea(\r\n                cList: Column(\r\n                   cListren: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                    SizedBox(\r\n                      height: 20.0,\r\n                    ),\r\n                    BlocBuilder(\r\n                      bloc: clistApiBLoC,\r\n                      builder: (BuildContext context, CListApiState state) {\r\n                            if(state is CListInitialState){    \r\n                              if(state.cList.length&gt;0){\r\n                                return Flexible(\r\n                                  child: Container(\r\n                                    margin: EdgeInsets.all(0.0),\r\n                                    child: ListView.builder(\r\n                                      controller: _scrollController,\r\n                                      padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 0.0, right: 0.0),\r\n                                      physics: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics(),\r\n                                      shrinkWrap: true,\r\n                                      itemCount: state.cList?.length??0,\r\n                                      itemBuilder: (BuildContext ctxt, int index) {\r\n                                         return CListIndividualCard(details: state.cList[index]);\r\n                                      },\r\n                                    ),\r\n                                  ),\r\n                                );\r\n                              }\r\n                              else{\r\n                                  return Container(\r\n                                    cList: Center(\r\n                                      cList: Text(&quot;No C Record Found&quot;),\r\n                                    ),\r\n                                  );\r\n                              }\r\n                            }\r\n                            if (state is CListApiStateError) {\r\n                              return Flexible(\r\n                                cList: Center(\r\n                                  cList: Text(state.errorMessage,style: errorStyle,),\r\n                                ),\r\n                              );\r\n                            }\r\n                            if (state is LoadingState) {\r\n                              return Flexible(\r\n                                cList: Center(\r\n                                  cList:CircularProgressIndicator(),\r\n                                ),\r\n                              );\r\n                            }\r\n                            return Container(height: 0, width: 0,);\r\n                        },\r\n                      ),                    \r\n                  ],\r\n                )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the CIndidividualCard codes.\r\n```\r\nclass _CListIndividualCardState extends State&lt;CListIndividualCard&gt;

How would I write a SQL query to do this? (using SQL Server, SSMS)\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have contract details which consist of products and end users. Each of these lines has a date. For each Contract #, I want to compare the Begin and End dates of the products and end users. And I want to eliminate certain lines if a distributor begin date &gt; than the product end date.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample table:\r\n\r\n[Sample Table][1]\r\n\r\n    Contract\tType\t TypeCode\tBegin Date\tEnd Date\r\n    11111\t    Product\t 12345\t    1/1/2019\t12/31/2019\r\n    11111\t    Product\t 67890\t    8/1/2019\t12/31/2020\r\n    11111\t    EndUser\t AAA\t    1/1/2018\t12/31/2019\r\n    11111\t    EndUser\t BBB\t    1/1/2020\t12/31/2020\r\n    22222\t    Product\t 12345\t    1/1/2019\t12/31/2019\r\n    22222\t    Product\t 67890\t    1/1/2019\t12/31/2019\r\n    22222\t    EndUser\t AAA\t    8/1/2019\t12/31/2020\r\n    22222\t    EndUser\t BBB\t    1/1/2019\t12/31/2019\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IL6mq.png\r\n\r\nLooking at row 4, the begin date for the end user occurs occurs after the end date for row 1.
