Here&#39;s a video explanation of the issue.](https://youtu.be/8mwDzSIjUCI)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve included a video as it makes things much clearer. The problem: When I first load up the fragment containing the list of items with state I need to toggle, I can toggle that state just fine. I send the update to the Room database and the changes are emitted back to my ViewModel, who then dispatches them to the Fragment.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I leave the fragment and come back, the changes are no longer dispatched. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something incredibly stupid or if this is a bug.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also using the Jetpack Navigation components if that&#39;s relevant. I&#39;ll include code below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need to see any other code referenced below and I&#39;ll add it to the question.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and

Let&#39;s clarify problem\r\n\r\nQuestion is not about particular database as pgsql/mysql/sqlite/other but for any generic database drive. \r\n\r\nSo the answer must be in  `database/sql/driver`.\r\nLet&#39;s go further.\r\n\r\n## 2. `sql/driver`. Interfaces: `Queryer`/`QueryerContext` &amp; `Execer`/`ExecerContext`\r\n\r\nModule `sql/driver` defines interfaces:\r\n\r\n - `Queryer`/`QeueryerContext` - for ability to `(*DB).Query`\r\n - `Execer`/`ExecerContext` - for `(*DB).Exec`\r\n - others such as `Pinger`\r\n\r\nNote that **every interface** described in documentation as _&quot; an optional interface that may be implemented by a Conn&quot;_\r\n\r\nWhich means that it&#39;s possible to implement sql driver without `Query` and/or `Exec`.\r\n\r\n## 3. Experimental verification\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try to implement **correct** database driver that cannot `Query` and `Exec`: https://play.golang.org/p/sZiigEghphE\r\n\r\n```golang\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t&quot;database/sql&quot;\r\n\t&quot;database/sql/driver&quot;\r\n\t&quot;log&quot;\r\n)\r\n\r\ntype expdrv struct{}\r\ntype expconn struct{}\r\n\r\n// sql.Driver implementation\r\nfunc (*expdrv) Open(name string) (driver.Conn, error) {\r\n\treturn &amp;expconn{}, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\n// driver.Conn implementation\r\nfunc (c *expconn) Prepare(query string) (driver.Stmt, error) {\r\n\treturn nil, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (c *expconn) Close() error {\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (c *expconn) Begin() (driver.Tx, error) {\r\n\treturn nil, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tsql.Register(&quot;drvexp&quot;, &amp;expdrv{})\r\n\tlog.Printf(&quot;Registred drivers: %v\\n&quot;, sql.Drivers())\r\n\r\n\tdb, err := sql.Open(&quot;drvexp&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\r\n\tlog.Printf(&quot;sql.Open() success: %v, error: %v&quot;, db != nil, err)\r\n\r\n\tlog.Println(&quot;db.Close() error:&quot;, db.Close())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 Registred drivers: [drvexp]\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 sql.Open() success: true, error: &lt;nil&gt;\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 db.Ping()  success: true\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 db.Close() success: true\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 db.Ping()  result:  sql: database is closed\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nIt works!\r\nThis `Driver` implementation is:\r\n\r\n- correct from `database/sql` standpoint\r\n- has no working methods `Query` and `Exec` (attempt will throw panic)\r\n- surprisingly working `Ping()`\r\n\r\n## 4. Possibility to implement `Exec` or `Query` independently of each other\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s add `Exec`:\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n// driver.Result &amp; driver.Execer\r\ntype expresult struct{}\r\n\r\nfunc (*expconn) Exec(query string, args []driver.Value) (driver.Result, error) {\r\n\treturn &amp;expresult{}, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (*expresult) LastInsertId() (int64, error) {\r\n\treturn 0, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (*expresult) RowsAffected() (int64, error) {\r\n\treturn 0, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill allow: \r\n```golang\r\n_, err = db.Exec(&quot;BYE&quot;)\r\nfmt.Println(&quot;db.Exec() success:&quot;, err == nil) // Outputs: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Conclusion\r\n\r\n- Ability to call `Query/QueryContext` and/or `Exec/ExecContext` are optional \r\n\r\n- Behaviour of those methods can vary at great length between drivers\r\n\r\n- **In general case there is no correct answer exists**   \r\n\r\n- For particular cases (with specific driver):\r\n  - **it&#39;s possible to suppose** that `db.Query` would work for most cases \r\n  - but **it&#39;s impossible to guarantee** that `Query` will really work without experimental verification \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention!\r\n\r\nI suppose that&#39;s the final answer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209730/determine-whether-to-use-db-exec-or-db-query-from-unknown-query-string/58257302#58257302","title":"Determine whether to use DB.Exec or DB.Query from unknown query string"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10934779,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b21f6833318622afddfd4502b8d6abfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10934779/jack"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1683,"user_id":3653343,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wC454.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nikaido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3653343/nikaido"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570365533,"creation_date":1570052490,"last_edit_date":1570068112,"question_id":58209730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209730","body_markdown":"Using &quot;`database/sql`&quot;, `sql.DB.Exec()` is used for queries that do not return rows (`insert, delete, update`) and `sql.DB.Query(`) for queries that return rows (`selects`).\r\nAssume you have an incoming query string which you wish to execute, however you do not know whether the query intends to return rows.\r\nCan you think of a way to find out whether to use Exec or Query?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209730/determine-whether-to-use-db-exec-or-db-query-from-unknown-query-string","title":"Determine whether to use DB.Exec or DB.Query from unknown query string"},{"tags":["android","air","android-view"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":921556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f668812e38bacb294cd6a0a84cfa779c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Felix Ekenstam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/921556/felix-ekenstam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570093339,"post_id":58209728,"comment_id":102807646,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209728/adobe-air-back-button-event-not-working-with-android-api-28#comment102807646_58209728"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":427,"user_id":1162792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjGqP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rodrigo.C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1162792/rodrigo-c"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570135646,"creation_date":1570135646,"answer_id":58226671,"question_id":58209728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58226671","body_markdown":"Finally I found the problem, it&#39;s related to the focus not being assigned to AIRWindowSurfaceView when I target the game to Android API 28.\r\n\r\nThis is the code I have to run when the ANE is initialized in order to restore the focus:\r\n    \r\n      AndroidActivityWrapper aaw = AndroidActivityWrapper.GetAndroidActivityWrapper();\r\n      aaw.getView().requestFocus();\r\n      aaw.getView().onWindowFocusChanged(true);\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209728/adobe-air-back-button-event-not-working-with-android-api-28/58226671#58226671","title":"Adobe AIR back button event not working with Android API 28+"}],"owner":{"reputation":427,"user_id":1162792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjGqP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rodrigo.C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1162792/rodrigo-c"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58226671,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570981651,"creation_date":1570052461,"question_id":58209728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209728","body_markdown":"The key_down event is not being fired and we are not able to prevent the app to be closed.

Or in other words, delayed expansion cannot be nested.\r\n\r\nYou can use [`call`][cmdcal] though to introduce another parsing phase, like this:\r\n\r\n    call echo %%CLs[!count!]%%\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe line `IF NOT %%I == CLs[!count!] ( ... )` is wrong, you must expand the right value too. However, `call if` will not help unfortunately, because `if` (like `for` and `rem`) is a special command that is recognised by the parser earlier than others, like `call`.\r\n\r\nTo work around that you can store the value of `!count!` in a [`for`][cmdfor] meta-variable, like `%%J`, for instance, to introduce another parsing phase, and use `!CLs[%%J]!` then, like this:\r\n\r\n    set /A &quot;count=0&quot;\r\n    for /F &quot;tokens=5&quot; %%I in (&#39;some command&#39;) do (\r\n        for %%J in (!count!) do (\r\n            echo !CLs[%%J]!\r\n            if not &quot;%%I&quot; == &quot;!CLs[%%J]!&quot; (\r\n                set /A &quot;count+=1&quot;\r\n                set &quot;CLs[!count!]=%%I&quot;\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnother yet slower possibility is to put the relevant code into a sub-routine:\r\n\r\n    set /A &quot;count=0&quot;\r\n    for /F &quot;tokens=5&quot; %%I in (&#39;some command&#39;) do (\r\n        call :SUB !count!\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    goto :EOF\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    :SUB\r\n        echo !CLs[%~1]!\r\n        if not &quot;%%I&quot; == &quot;!CLs[%~1]!&quot; (\r\n            set /A &quot;count+=1&quot;\r\n            set &quot;CLs[%~1]=%%I&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        goto :EOF\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou may also take a look at the post [Arrays, linked lists and other data structures in cmd.exe (batch) script][relan2] about how to deal with such pseudo-arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [relan1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4095133\r\n            (How does the Windows Command Interpreter (CMD.EXE) parse scripts?)\r\n  [relan2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10167990\r\n            (Arrays, linked lists and other data structures in cmd.exe (batch) script)\r\n  [cmdcal]: https://ss64.com/nt/call.html\r\n            (CALL)\r\n  [cmdfor]: https://ss64.com/nt/FOR.html\r\n            (FOR)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209698/double-expansion-on-array-index-windows-batch/58210198#58210198","title":"Double Expansion on Array Index Windows Batch"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":63472,"user_id":2128947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ASTM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Magoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2128947/magoo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570119168,"creation_date":1570119168,"answer_id":58223088,"question_id":58209698,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223088","body_markdown":"    ECHO ------------- START AT %time%\r\n    \r\n    REM &lt;!-- language: lang-dos --&gt;\r\n    @ECHO Off\r\n    setlocal enableextensions ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION\r\n    \r\n    SET &quot;sourcedir=U:\\sourcedir&quot;\r\n    SET &quot;filename1=%sourcedir%\\q58209698.txt&quot;\r\n    \r\n    SET CLs[0]=#\r\n    SET /a clscnt[0]=0\r\n    \r\n    SET /A count = 0\r\n    FOR /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %%I IN (&#39;type %filename1%&#39;) DO (\r\n     SET &quot;processed=&quot;\r\n     FOR /f &quot;tokens=1,2,3delims=[]=&quot; %%a IN (&#39;set cls[&#39;) DO IF /i &quot;%%a&quot;==&quot;cls&quot; (\r\n      IF &quot;%%I&quot;==&quot;%%c&quot; (SET /a clscnt[%%b]+=1&amp;SET &quot;processed=y&quot;)\r\n     )\r\n     IF not DEFINED processed SET /a count+=1&amp;SET &quot;cls[!count!]=%%I&quot;&amp;SET /a clscnt[!count!]=1\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    FOR /L %%a IN (0,1,%count%) DO ECHO !clscnt[%%a]! times !cls[%%a]!\r\n    \r\n    ENDLOCAL\r\n    ECHO -------------------------Second way -----------------\r\n    @ECHO Off\r\n    setlocal enableextensions ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION\r\n    \r\n    SET &quot;sourcedir=U:\\sourcedir&quot;\r\n    SET &quot;filename1=%sourcedir%\\q58209698.txt&quot;\r\n    \r\n    SET CLs[0]=#\r\n    SET /a clscnt[0]=0\r\n    \r\n    SET /A count = 0\r\n    FOR /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %%I IN (&#39;type %filename1%&#39;) DO (\r\n     SET &quot;processed=&quot;\r\n     FOR /L %%a IN (0,1,!count!)

This gives you an instance of WebDriver to use in your code, and you don&#39;t have to perform Setup or Teardown in your test class either:\r\n\r\n````\r\npublic class MyTestClass : Base\r\n{\r\n    // this test method will perform setup (inherited from base), run the test, then teardown (also inherited from base)\r\n    public void MyTest_1()\r\n    {\r\n        // perform webdriver actions in the test case\r\n        element = driver.FindElement(someSelector);\r\n\r\n        // initialize a PageObject\r\n        PageObject myPageObject = new PageObject(driver);\r\n\r\n        // perform some action using a PageObject\r\n        myPageObject.EnterTextIntoForm();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou can also use this `driver` instance to initialize PageObjects:\r\n\r\n````\r\npublic class MyPageObject\r\n{\r\n    public MyPageObject(driver)\r\n    { }\r\n\r\n    public void EnterTextIntoField\r\n    {\r\n       // we can use the same driver instance here\r\n        driver.FindElement(someSelector).SendKeys(someField);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo this pattern allows your WebDriver instance to be used in test cases and page objects to perform all sorts of testing functions. You can abstract setup and teardown into the base class, and you will not have to write the same setup and teardown method over and over in your code. \r\n\r\nThe only downside to this approach is that it takes longer to write a framework and adds a layer of complexity to your code. But there is really no down side, and abstracting your WebDriver into a base class as such is usually considered best practice.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209646/the-purpose-of-passing-the-web-driver-object-into-page-object-base-classs-const/58209761#58209761","title":"The purpose of passing the web driver object into page object base class&#39;s constructor"}],"owner":{"reputation":257,"user_id":3428261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pKg2q.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"QAAuto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3428261/qaauto"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16663,"user_id":2756409,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UIrGI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TylerH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2756409/tylerh"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570138218,"creation_date":1570051911,"last_edit_date":1570138218,"question_id":58209646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209646","body_markdown":"I have seen the web driver object is having in the page object base class level&#39;s constructor as follows. \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class PageObjectBase \r\n{\r\n    protected WebDriver driver;\r\n\r\n    public PageObjectBase(WebDriver driver){\r\n   \r\n        driver = this.driver;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class LoginPage extends PageObjectBase \r\n{\r\n  \r\n    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver){\r\n   \r\n        super(driver);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

chrome.cookies API is not clear to me. I want to getAll cookies for 3 different Domains, then delete those and wait for this process to finish, afterwards I want to set some cookies.\r\n\r\nIf I understand cookies chrome.cookies.getAll does not return a promise, only I can define a callback. Now its clear to me that I can write callbacks for all three getAll cookies commands but in there I am removing several cookies again this process goes asynchronously. So I am totally lost on how I can identify when all cookies of 3 domains have been completely removed.\r\n\r\nOne option that I could think of is that I run the 3 cookie.getAlls one time ahead and count the number of cookies, then with every remove I increase a counter and in a callback of remove I check whether I have reached the total number. This seems very strange so I can not believe that this is the correct way to do it.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209642/chrome-cookies-getall-and-remove-all-cookies-then-wait-for-finish","title":"chrome.cookies.getAll and remove all cookies then wait for finish"},{"tags":["android","reverse-engineering"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10186518,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/273e873d0d321a614c647302bb25b490?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Serdar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10186518/serdar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2415,"user_id":4109713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Z0gtVzo_pVg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/zf9eXprNRfE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andre Classen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4109713/andre-classen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570052691,"creation_date":1570051856,"last_edit_date":1570052691,"question_id":58209640,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209640","body_markdown":"I am new at reverse engineering.

Replace the `*` with `.*`. Simply put, in regex `*` denotes the same (set) of characters any number of times (`abc*` matches `abccccc`), whereas `.*` denotes any character any number of times (`abc.*` matches `abccccc`, `abcdefg`, `abcadkhsdalksd`, etc.).\r\n 2. Remove the double quotes `&quot;` surrounding the regex patterns; lest you want them to be interpreted as string literals.\r\n 3. Wrap the regex patterns within delimiters, usually `/` to define the string boundary.\r\n 4. The brackets `()` themselves are optional here.\r\n 5. To match regular expressions, replace the equal operator `==` with the match operator `==~` (strict), which returns a boolean.\r\n 6. There is no &quot;NOT match&quot; operator in Groovy. To invert the match, you need to invert the result of the entire expression. \r\n 7. If the `+` in `*+*`should be a literal, then you must escape it as `*\\+*`.\r\n\r\nStitching these together, your pipeline should look like:\r\n\r\n    stage(&#39;Release  1&#39;) {\r\n        when {\r\n            expression {\r\n    \t\t    params.SECRET_NAME != &quot;&quot;

It has to have following return type and parameter types:\r\n\r\n    SDL_HitTestResult MyCallback(SDL_Window* win, const SDL_Point* area, void* data)\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`area-&gt;x` and `area-&gt;y` are the coordinates of the pixel that&#39;s being checked. `win` is the window.\r\n\r\n`data` will receive the same pointer you passed to `callback_data` when calling `SDL_SetWindowHitTest`. You can use this pointer to pass arbitrary data to your callback; or, if you don&#39;t need it, simply set it to `0`.\r\n\r\nYour callback should return one of the following:\r\n\r\n* `SDL_HITTEST_NORMAL` - no action.\r\n* `SDL_HITTEST_DRAGGABLE` - dragging this pixel moves the window.\r\n* `SDL_HITTEST_RESIZE_*` - dragging this pixel resizes a specific edge (or edges) of the window.

are many ways to do this. I suggest you use the `ToCharArray` method to get an array of characters. Then you can loop trough the characters and determine which ones are at the first and last characters of words and change the case of the letters. This way you do only one pass and do not do any string building or concatenation.\r\n\r\nHere are sample methods that cover both scenarios and a combined one where you set the first and last characters to lower. For upper case you just replace the `ToLower` call with a call to `ToUpper`.\r\n\r\n    private static string FirstLetterOfWordToLowercase(string stringToTransform)\r\n    {\r\n       char[]

I guess something like moving the loss tensor back to my cpu would work, but I haven&#39;t found any hacky way to do that.\r\n\r\nI know it is possible to get that result because when I encapsulate my model with `keras` under a TPU distribution strategy and use `model.fit` instead of my custom training loop, I can get the loss metrics printed. \r\n\r\nSo there must be a way and any help in finding this is greatly appreciated :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209604/is-it-possible-to-print-value-of-tpu-cloud-variable-in-tensorflow","title":"Is it possible to print value of TPU cloud variable in tensorflow?"},{"tags":["python","parallel-processing","dask"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570053165,"post_id":58209596,"comment_id":102797261,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209596/dask-parallelizing-across-nested-lists#comment102797261_58209596"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31528,"user_id":616616,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8749ec52cee260c4c1f67f2dec29d957?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MRocklin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616616/mrocklin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":31528,"user_id":616616,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8749ec52cee260c4c1f67f2dec29d957?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MRocklin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/616616/mrocklin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570157478,"last_edit_date":1570157478,"creation_date":1570112543,"answer_id":58221174,"question_id":58209596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58221174","body_markdown":"Yes, there are a variety of ways of doing this well.  \r\n\r\nThere is an example here: https://examples.dask.org/applications/evolving-workflows.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209596/dask-parallelizing-across-nested-lists/58221174#58221174","title":"Dask: Parallelizing across nested lists"}],"owner":{"reputation":4803,"user_id":1274908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gv5Fr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ericmjl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1274908/ericmjl"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4803,"user_id":1274908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gv5Fr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ericmjl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1274908/ericmjl"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58221174,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570157478,"creation_date":1570051670,"last_edit_date":1570062378,"question_id":58209596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209596","body_markdown":"I have a problem with parallelizing across a nested list of lists.\r\n\r\nA simplified version of my problem looks like this:\r\n\r\nI have a list of lists:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[a, b], [c, d, e], [f, g, h, i], [j], [k, l], ...]  # let&#39;s call this &quot;L&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Dask, I use a function to create them, because creating each sub-list takes a long time, and I have roughly a few hundred of them.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef parse(filename):\r\n    return list_of_lists\r\n\r\nL = []\r\nfor fname in filenames:\r\n    L.append(client.submit(parse, fname))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key here, though, is that I would like to treat the sublists as a single extended list of elements (i.e. `[a, b, c,... l, ...]`) and parallelize another long-running function on each of them, but without gathering my elements and flattening the list.

Furthermore, which exact version of MySQL is running in Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7?**\r\n\r\nIf Google Cloud SQL deals with all the upgrading, I&#39;m inclined to try to force my company to move the in house database to Google Cloud since the only reason the database is in house is due to legacy and historical reasons.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209569/google-cloud-sql-mysql-5-7-minor-versions-how-do-upgrades-happen","title":"Google Cloud SQL Mysql 5.7 minor versions, how do upgrades happen?"},{"tags":["git","git-branch"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1458,"user_id":4638004,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAveK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VelikiiNehochuha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4638004/velikiinehochuha"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570051882,"post_id":58209568,"comment_id":102796924,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209568/safely-renaming-remote-origin-branch#comment102796924_58209568"},{"owner":{"reputation":3426,"user_id":2540407,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70244e2142d529ec009d23422d404ba1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2540407/michael"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1458,"user_id":4638004,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAveK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VelikiiNehochuha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4638004/velikiinehochuha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570052646,"post_id":58209568,"comment_id":102797139,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209568/safely-renaming-remote-origin-branch#comment102797139_58209568"},{"owner":{"reputation":230206,"user_id":1256452,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa1648baa6108c85886312af93bb32c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"torek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256452/torek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570082382,"post_id":58209568,"comment_id":102802855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209568/safely-renaming-remote-origin-branch#comment102802855_58209568"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570055436,"creation_date":1570055436,"answer_id":58210135,"question_id":58209568,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210135","body_markdown":"I recommend creating a `new_branch` and informing the other developers to use the new branch (and deleting the `old_branch`). \r\n\r\nIn case a developer keeps using the old branch you can just merge their commits to the `new_branch` until he switches to the `new_branch`.

We are migrating to Service Fabric and I have a few questions. Our intent is to migrate the services to StateFul service since we need to keep track of locations of files, batch size, etc.  that are currently stored in an app.config file.  So we can &quot;lift and shift&quot; the code from the onTimer event to the RunAsync as discussed in this stackoverflow question:\r\n[How to Migrate Windows Service in Azure Service Fabric][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41569030/how-to-migrate-windows-service-in-azure-service-fabric\r\n\r\nHowever there are some questions I have about these services.  Of course part of using SF is to have the applications in a reliable environment to keep these applications available as much as possible, so the first question is:\r\n\r\n    Should we only deploy the service to one node and use the reliable \r\n    collection to maintain the state of the process should the node go down and \r\n    have to be brought back up?  \r\n    \r\n    Or, should we deploy the application to say 3 nodes and just have each \r\n    application on their node check the reliable collection to see if another \r\n    application is processing files and to wait? \r\n    files?\r\n\r\nThe application will &quot;awake&quot; at a determined interval and look at a folder, if there are any files in the folder, it will process them.  This could take from a couple of seconds to many minutes.  So if the application on was on three nodes, it is entirely possible that the other two applications on their nodes would wake up to process files.  If they could check a reliable dictionary to see if one of the other instances of the application is running the file processing, they would just wait until the next time they are needed.\r\n\r\nI know this is vague, I am looking for input on whether to launch the application on multiple nodes or a single node?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209553/running-a-windows-service-as-a-statefull-service-in-service-fabric","title":"Running a Windows Service as a statefull service in Service Fabric"},{"tags":["c#","nginx","asp.net-core"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12156096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBdR1LG0eoQeGvVpIRovaZl8QFzL3acdOzsNWg_rQ=k-s128","display_name":"Scott Rassbach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12156096/scott-rassbach"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570051418,"creation_date":1570051418,"question_id":58209551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209551","body_markdown":"I am working with the Identity set on an ASP.NET Core 3.0 application, deployed to Ubuntu 19.04.\r\n\r\nThe Identity areas don&#39;t seem to be working correctly.

You store those in a dictionary, and then ask the user if they want to add more items to the list or quit. If they add more to the list, the script wants you to add it to a &quot;list&quot;, where the dictionary entry is nested. When the user quits the program, it is supposed to print out something of this nature.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2 milk at $2.99 ea for a total of: x  \r\n1 eggs at 1.99 ea for a total of: x  \r\nGrand total: x\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy problem is: I can get it to print out in this manner, however it will **only** print out the same line over and over again.

There were some updates that needed to be pushed out and I was able to push them out onto the Ubuntu server without issue. The websites are all functioning and accessing the database as normal.  However, when I went to push the updates onto the CentOS server, I discovered Tomcat was no longer running.  After trying to figure that out, eventually I gave up and reinstalled Tomcat. Now I have tomcat running ok, but I&#39;m having a problem reaching the database server.  Again, there is another server in the same VPC able to make connections and I can telnet from the problem server to the database server on port 1433.  This is NOT a connectivity problem.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nI am not able to use the Microsoft JDBC driver at all to reach the database.  When I try to do it from a basic java application, I receive \r\n&gt; com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: &quot;RSA premaster secret error&quot;. ClientConnectionId:6937523b-5b55-400a-8189-defa007049f7\r\n\r\nHowever, when I use JTDS to reach the database, it indicates a successful connection. In Tomcat, I see a different error using the Microsoft JDBC driver:\r\n\r\n&gt; com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The TCP/IP connection to the host 10.205.164.153, port 1433 has failed. Error: &quot;Permission denied (connect failed). Verify the connection properties. Make sure that an instance of SQL Server is running on the host and accepting TCP/IP connections at the port. Make sure that TCP connections to the port are not blocked by a firewall.&quot;. \r\n\r\nSo, I tried using JTDS in Tomcat. However, I am still unable to connect receiving this error:\r\n\r\n&gt; java.sql.SQLException: Network error IOException: Permission denied (connect failed) \r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\nAs previously stated, I verified connectivity to the SQL Server instance.  I also verified that Java could connect using JTDS.  I modified the Catalina.policy file to explicitly allow the connection to the database server on port 1433.  Is there any other reason it would throw this error?  Is it SSL related?  Did a recent Java update require an SSL certificate on my database server?  All of our database interactions are internal to the VPC only so a certificate hasn&#39;t really seemed necessary yet.  Is there any way to get more debugging output?  Any help would be greatly appreciated as this really has us in a lurch.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209544/tomcat-7-jtds-sql-server-connection-issue","title":"Tomcat 7 - JTDS SQL Server connection issue"},{"tags":["apache","mod-auth-form"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":8479219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uKcaxpEhkR0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQg/g_i--kzLfuk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Derek White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479219/derek-white"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570051386,"creation_date":1570051386,"answer_id":58209542,"question_id":58209541,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58209542","body_markdown":"Found out I could use the variables directly in the SSI; so, I removed the `SetEnvIf`s from my vhost.

No login/logout URLs seen in user&#39;s browser. When the user logs out, the message should not be shown when they are 401&#39;d back to the inline login page.\r\n\r\nI am currently using an `onsubmit` function to set a flag in `sessionStorage`. If the page loads (body `onload` function) and sees this flag, it will show the error message (e.g. user entered wrong credentials and are back here again). This works fine, until they logout. They are 401&#39;d to the login page and the flag is still there, so they see the error message.\r\n\r\nI need to clear the message somehow.\r\n\r\nWell, GET vs POST! The initial page load is a GET and the logout is a GET; so, only failed logins would be loading this page with a POST.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s activate SSI and use an env var (this is on both login and logout Location directives):\r\n\r\n```SetEnvIf Request_Method &quot;^GET$&quot; LOGIN-ERROR-CLEAR=&quot;1&quot;```\r\n\r\nInject some JS to our init to clear the sessionStorage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!--#if expr=&quot;reqenv(&#39;LOGIN-ERROR-CLEAR&#39;) == &#39;1&#39;&quot; --&gt;\r\nsessionStorage.removeItem(&#39;login-attempted&#39;);\r\n&lt;!--#endif --&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSounds logical...but, it doesn&#39;t work. The JS is not injected.\r\n\r\n - `GET /logout` -&gt; 307 to &quot;/&quot; (due to `AuthFormLogoutLocation &quot;/&quot;`)\r\n - `GET /` -&gt; 401 with content of /login.html\r\n - error message is wrongly shown\r\n\r\nAll GETs, yet the JS was not injected. What is going on? I am back where I started before using SetEnvIf - there is no difference. It&#39;s not doing anything!\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to trigger an error message and clear the trigger after successful login or logout?
