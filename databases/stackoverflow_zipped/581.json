value.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved with operator overload on the * and +, but when i would try to do with trigonometrical functions, it doesnt work.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what i&#39;ve been trying to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto f = sin(x);\r\n```\r\nthat would later be invoked with an \r\n```\r\nf.e(5);\r\n```\r\nBut its unable to do that because sin only accepts numbers as arguments, how would i go

Once you map your state to props you usually want to pass them directly to child components. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nQuick fix: use this.props.isLoading instead of state, and set isLoading to true inside your dispatched action","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402613/materialui-spinning-loader-help-needed-for-react-redux-app/58403002#58403002","title":"MaterialUI Spinning loader help needed for React/Redux app"}],"owner":{"reputation":360,"user_id":5526303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9228b5cb33e94f190938c4613e781ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Roger Dodger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5526303/roger-dodger"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571176935,"creation_date":1571173398,"question_id":58402613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402613","body_markdown":"       import { CircularProgress, FormControl, Input, InputLabel } from \r\n       &#39;@material-ui/core&#39;;\r\n        function toKey(s) {\r\n\t    return s.split(&quot;_&quot;).map((s, i) =&gt;

my build system, I would like to avoid rebuilding a subproject if none of its files changed. The basic idea is this:\r\n\r\n1. After doing `make all`, I hash the contents of the directory and save it.\r\n2. The next time I want to build the project, hash the contents of the directory again.\r\n3. If the hashes are equal, we are done. Otherwise, go to 1.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to implement this in GNU Make, using this helper script named `update-hash`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nHASH_FILE=$1\r\nSRC_DIR=$2\r\n\r\necho Hashing sources\r\nUPDATED_HASH=$(tar c $SRC_DIR | sha256sum | cut -c-64)\r\nSAVED_HASH=$(&lt;$HASH_FILE)\r\nif [[ $SAVED_HASH != $UPDATED_HASH ]]; then\r\n    echo &quot;Updating hash&quot;\r\n    echo $UPDATED_HASH &gt; $HASH_FILE\r\nelse\r\n    echo &quot;$HASH_FILE is up to date. Not touching it.&quot;\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the tricky part: since Make relies on file modification times to decide what to build, I use two files, `pre_hash` and `post_hash`, and take advantage of the fact that my `update-hash` script does not update the file if the hashes match.\r\n```\r\nsubproject: update_pre_hash post_hash\r\n\r\npost_hash: pre_hash\r\n        make -C subproject clean all\r\n        update-hash pre_hash subproject\r\n        cp pre_hash post_hash\r\n\r\nupdate_pre_hash:\r\n        update-hash pre_hash subproject\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way this works is like this:\r\n\r\n* On the first run of `make subproject`, the `pre_hash` file gets updated, and so the `post_hash` rule gets built, ending with a built subproject and with a `post_hash` file that is newer than `pre_hash`.\r\n* On subsequent runs, `update_pre_hash` always gets invoked, but doesn&#39;t update the `pre_hash` file, and so the `post_hash` rule does not get invoked.\r\n* If any file in the subproject changes, the `pre_hash` file gets updated, and so `post_hash` gets invoked, resulting in a full build and new hash files.\r\n\r\nMy question is: will this actually work? Some basic testing did not reveal any glaring problems, but it seems a little shaky. I&#39;m particularly worried about relying on the dependencies of `subproject` getting evaluated in order, which I know is an invalid assumption with `make -j`, but maybe there&#39;s a way to fix that. \r\n\r\n* Do you see a problem with this implementation?\r\n* If you do, can you suggest any fixes?\r\n* Do you know of another (maybe better) way to achieve the same effect? (other than the obvious &quot;fix the subproject to no-op if there are no changes&quot; - I don&#39;t want to maintain the subproject&#39;s build process)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Update**: @dash-o suggested a much simpler approach, with a Makefile like this:\r\n```\r\nlast_update: $(shell find subproject -type f)\r\n        make -C subproject clean all\r\n        touch last_update\r\n```\r\nThis way, `last_update` is always newer than all the files in subproject, but if any files change later, a rebulid will be triggered.

taking a quick look at [the Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html), there is no `push` method. However, what I think you are looking for is the `add` method, which adds the given item to the end of the `Vector` (or if an additional integer is provided, at that index of the `Vector`). In your example, this would look like\r\n```java\r\nclass VeryLong {\r\n    Vector&lt;Integer&gt; A = new Vector&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n\r\n    VeryLong(int n) {\r\n        while (n &gt; 0) {\r\n            A.add(0, n % 10);\r\n            n /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIn this case, I wrote `A.add(0, n % 10);` since you want the &quot;less significant&quot; digits towards the end. Each successive digit added will push the existing elements to the &quot;right&quot; or end of the list in this case. This should solve your problem. :)\r\n\r\nAs acarlstein pointed out, using a `Vector` in this case is not necessarily recommended. Quoting from the [`Vector` Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html),\r\n&gt; As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to implement the `List` interface, making it a member of the Java Collections Framework. Unlike the new collection implementations, `Vector` is synchronized. If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use `ArrayList` in place of `Vector`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402545/pushing-elements-to-vector-in-java/58403192#58403192","title":"Pushing elements to Vector in java"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12216488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EINUcUuEu7U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reEtG9zPbQfjjCZIvWarhfIIgSL6g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Edward Chinaski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216488/edward-chinaski"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12216488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EINUcUuEu7U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reEtG9zPbQfjjCZIvWarhfIIgSL6g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Edward Chinaski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216488/edward-chinaski"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58403192,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571179806,"creation_date":1571173066,"last_edit_date":1571179806,"question_id":58402545,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402545","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing my own custom BigInteger class in Java, and want to parse Integers in the constructor of my class. So question is, how can I add each digit of my number n to my vector properly, keeping the correct sequence? In other words, how can I add each digit to it like if I were adding them into the stack? \r\n\r\n\r\nE.g. for `n = 1234` i need to add this like 1 2 3 4 to my vector.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what I already have:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass VeryLong {\r\n    Vector&lt;Integer&gt; A = new Vector&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n\r\n    VeryLong(int n) {\r\n        while (n &gt; 0) {\r\n            // A.push(n % 10)\r\n            n /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere goes another problem, I need to overload constructor of the class to create an instance of VeryLong from int and long. Here is my code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private ArrayList&lt;Long&gt; A = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    private VeryLong(int n) {\r\n        while (n &gt; 0) {\r\n            A.add(long()(n % 10));\r\n            n /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        while (!A.isEmpty()) {\r\n            System.out.println(A.get(0));\r\n            A.remove(0);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private VeryLong(long n) {\r\n        while (n &gt; 0) {\r\n            A.add(n % 10);\r\n            n /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        while (!A.isEmpty()) {\r\n            System.out.println(A.get(0));\r\n            A.remove(0);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIf I define `ArrayList` of `Long` there goes error in constructor first constuctor. Similarly, it&#39;s error in `add()` method in second, if i defina `A` as `Vector&lt;Integer&gt; A = new Vector&lt;Integer&gt;();`. How can I fix it?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402545/pushing-elements-to-vector-in-java","title":"Pushing elements to Vector in java"},{"tags":["api","credit-card"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3501790,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a9345dd489a1c36b219ab9fddb2c786?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3501790","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3501790/user3501790"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":4,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571173063,"creation_date":1571173063,"question_id":58402544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402544","body_markdown":"I am trying to find out if there are any APIs provided by a trusted org which allows an application to view and activate credit card offers.\r\n\r\nVisited solutions provided by plaid.com and yodlee but don&#39;t think those are relevant.

congratulations on an extremely clear question despite your newness to the site.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not that you have multiple `ifelse` statements, that is fine. The issue is that your `ifelse` statement is applying a single test to all turtles. Just look at the first example with one statement:\r\n\r\n    ifelse ticks mod 168 = 1 and random-float 100.0 &lt; 7.7\r\n      [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of underway-patches ] ]\r\n      [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n\r\nImagine that it is tick number 1. The computer runs the random number generator and gets 2. Great, the condition is true so the first block gets run. That will have ALL turtles move to the underway-patches. Similarly, if the random number generator returns 10, then the condition is false and ALL turtles move to home-patches.\r\n\r\nYou probably want something more like (you don&#39;t have to do the brackets on multiple lines, I did it so you can see the logical blocks of the structure):\r\n\r\n    ifelse ticks mod 168 = 1\r\n      [ ask turtles-on home-patches\r\n        [ if random-float 100.0 &lt; 7.7\r\n          [ move-to one-of underway-patches\r\n          ]\r\n        ]\r\n      ]\r\n      [ ask turtles-on underway-patches [ move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n\r\nOr if you want exactly the correct proportion of turtles to move:\r\n\r\n    ifelse ticks mod 168 = 1\r\n      [ let num-to-move 0.077 * count turtles-on home-patches\r\n        ask n-of num-to-move turtles-on home-patches\r\n        [ move-to one-of underway-patches\r\n        ]\r\n      ]\r\n      [ ask turtles-on underway-patches [ move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n\r\nJust a general observation, if you are going to code this for every possible starting time, you are going to have a lot of code that is identical except for the tick and the proportion. You state that you are new to NetLogo, so I don&#39;t want to jump too quickly to more advanced concepts, but come back when you&#39;re a little further along with having thought through your model and we can probably help you create a procedure that reduces the need to duplicate code.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE: One approach to reusing the code**\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t quite right because I&#39;m not really clear what sort of movement you want, but here is a complete model where the proportions are stored in a list and `ticks` is used to identify the correct item in the list. That proportion is then passed to a piece of code that moves turtles.\r\n\r\n    globals\r\n    [ home-patches\r\n      underway-patches\r\n      proportions\r\n    ]\r\n    \r\n    to setup\r\n      clear-all\r\n      set proportions [0 0.077 0.05 0.15]\r\n      set home-patches patches with [abs pxcor &lt;= 3 and abs pycor &lt;= 3]\r\n      ask home-patches [ set pcolor white ]\r\n      set underway-patches patches with [not member? self home-patches]\r\n      ask underway-patches [ set pcolor yellow ]\r\n      create-turtles 100\r\n      [ set color red\r\n      ]\r\n      reset-ticks\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    to go\r\n      move-turtles item (1 + ticks mod 3) proportions\r\n      tick\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    to move-turtles [#prop]\r\n      print #prop\r\n      ask turtles\r\n      [ ifelse member? patch-here home-patches\r\n        [ if random-float 1 &lt; #prop\r\n          [ move-to one-of underway-patches\r\n          ]\r\n        ]\r\n        [ move-to one-of home-patches\r\n        ]\r\n      ]\r\n    end","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402532/is-there-a-possibility-to-have-an-ifelse-statement-with-two-conditions-ticks-mo/58408988#58408988","title":"Is there a possibility to have an ifelse statement with two conditions (ticks mod and probability)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12064303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82dc2ecf8462a69ebc957f50dbc92fc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CoffeeloverGER","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12064303/coffeeloverger"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12064303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82dc2ecf8462a69ebc957f50dbc92fc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CoffeeloverGER","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12064303/coffeeloverger"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58408988,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571245225,"creation_date":1571173018,"last_edit_date":1571209337,"question_id":58402532,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402532","body_markdown":"I&#39;m fairly new to Netlogo but I want to build a model where an agent (a car driver) will leave his home at a certain hour with a certain probability. Let&#39;s say he leaves Monday morning at 1 am (if have linked the ticks to the time so one tick is one hour). \r\n\r\nI tried to work with ifelse-statements combined with a second statement which has to be verified in order for the entire statement to become true. In the example below the car / agent should leave with a probability of 7.7% its house and drive to a patch called underway-patches. Since one week has 168 hours, I tried to link the hour via the mod ticks (hence, mod ticks = 1 is equal to 1 am on a Monday morning).\r\n\r\nThis alone works: \r\n```\r\nifelse ticks mod 168 = 1 and random-float 100.0 &lt; 7.7\r\n  [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of underway-patches ] ]\r\n  [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine. So I have always about 7 out of 100 turtles moving to the underway-patch. \r\n\r\nBut If I now add the second hour, so 2 am, the first function does not work anymore (there are no turtles moving at all at 1 am - only at 2 am). I expect about 7 out of 100 turtles to move at 1 am to the underway-patch and then I expect about 5 out of 100 turtles to move at 2 am to the underway-patch (and the other 7 of the first hour should go back to the home-patches).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does not work anymore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n; Monday, 1 am\r\nifelse ticks mod 168 = 1 and random-float 100.0 &lt; 7.7\r\n  [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of underway-patches ] ]\r\n  [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n\r\n; Monday, 2 am\r\nifelse ticks mod 168 = 2 and random-float 100.0 &lt; 5.1\r\n  [ ask turtles [ move-to one-of underway-patches] ]\r\n  [ ask turtles [move-to one-of home-patches] ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI appreciate every help!

You can enable CloudWatch Logs in your Application settings to see exactly what was sent to DynamoDB.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not able to know what&#39;s wrong with your template because your sample lacks some information, if you can answers the questions pertaining to your application:\r\n- Where are the users stored? Are they stored in their own DDB table separate from the chores, and is the hash key on the users table `id` as well?\r\n- In the `chores` table how do you know which user your chore is `assignedTo` or `createdBy`? Is there a user id stored on the chore DDB item?\r\n- Is the request mapping template you posted corresponding to the resolver attached to `Chore.assignedTo`?

(&quot;WoW&quot; stands for &quot;Windows-on-Windows&quot;.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the reference [WoW64 Internals][1] describing how this subsystem is initialized:\r\n\r\n&gt; wow64!ProcessInit\r\n&gt; -----------------\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ... \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; It … tries to load the *wow64log.dll* from the constructed system\r\n&gt; directory. **Note that this DLL is never present in any released\r\n&gt; Windows installation** (it’s probably used internally by Microsoft for\r\n&gt; debugging of the WoW64 subsystem). Therefore, *load of this DLL will\r\n&gt; normally fail*. This isn’t problem, though, because no critical\r\n&gt; functionality of the WoW64 subsystem depends on it.\r\n\r\nAlthough that article is talking about the ARM64 architecture (which AFAIK is not what most PCs would be using) it sounds like much of the WoW64 system is similar to normal PCs.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://wbenny.github.io/2018/11/04/wow64-internals.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402523/missing-wow64log-dll-when-running-old-vb6-app/58412898#58412898","title":"missing wow64log.dll when running old vb6 app"}],"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":4618425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb84f2e2397db936fcc26a3bc408fcd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Edgar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4618425/edgar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":155,"user_id":4618425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb84f2e2397db936fcc26a3bc408fcd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Edgar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4618425/edgar"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571237997,"creation_date":1571172961,"last_edit_date":1571237997,"question_id":58402523,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402523","body_markdown":"I have an old vb6 application that I put on a windows 2016 server and been having issues with dependency files.

You use version not as it is intended to be used. The purpose of versioning is to provide **optimistic locking** and not simply indicate how many times has the entity changed. The intended usage scenario is following: *before* updating an entity you *should* read it from the database, then modify, then save. Hibernate checks if the version you are trying to save is the same as in the database.\r\n\r\nA) If the same, it will automatically increment version and save your entity, i.e. it will update the existing record in the database.\r\n\r\nB) If the version in the entity you are trying to save is less than the version in the database, it means you are trying to save an outdated version. It means you are not aware of changes that were done in the meanwhile. In such case Hibernate will throw an exception.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402494/spring-jpa-versioned-entity-hibernate-errors/58403042#58403042","title":"Spring JPA Versioned Entity hibernate errors"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11380516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h6zlwqzpp90/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfW8K0Hu5sDz2uaHyCj3_iRHVZxYg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kal Bond","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11380516/kal-bond"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571175902,"creation_date":1571172789,"question_id":58402494,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402494","body_markdown":"Is there a better way to update a versioned entity other than to catch exception and retrying ?\r\nBelow is the code\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Builder\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@Data\r\n@IdClass(com.test.domain.EmployeeKey.class)\r\npublic class Employee {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private Integer employeeId;\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private Double commission;\r\n    @Id\r\n    private LocalDate inputDate;\r\n    @Version\r\n    private Integer version;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class EmployeeKey  implements Serializable {\r\n    private Integer employeeId;\r\n    private java.time.LocalDate inputDate;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@SpringBootApplication\r\n@Slf4j\r\npublic class SampleApplication {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {\r\n        SpringApplication.run(SampleApplication.class, args);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Component\r\n    public class AppStartupRunner implements ApplicationRunner {\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        EmployeeRepo employeeRepo;\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {\r\n            log.info(&quot;Your application started with option names : {}&quot;, args.getOptionNames());\r\n            List&lt;Employee&gt; empList = new ArrayList();\r\n            Employee employeeComm1 = Employee.builder().employeeId(1).name(&quot;Sam&quot;).commission(100.45).inputDate(LocalDate.of(2019,10,01)).build();\r\n            Employee employeeComm2 = Employee.builder().employeeId(1).name(&quot;Sam&quot;).commission(87.54).inputDate(LocalDate.of(2019,10,01)).build();\r\n            Employee employeeComm3 = Employee.builder().employeeId(2).name(&quot;John&quot;).commission(56.78).inputDate(LocalDate.of(2019,10,01)).build();\r\n            Employee employeeComm4 = Employee.builder().employeeId(3).name(&quot;Katie&quot;).commission(65.23).inputDate(LocalDate.of(2019,10,01)).build();\r\n\r\n            empList.add(employeeComm1);\r\n            empList.add(employeeComm3);\r\n            empList.add(employeeComm4);\r\n            empList.add(employeeComm2);\r\n//            employeeRepo.saveAll(empList);\r\n            for (Employee emp: empList) {\r\n                try {\r\n                        employeeRepo.save(emp);\r\n                    }\r\n                 catch(Exception e) {\r\n                     if (employeeRepo.findByEmployeeIdAndInputDate(emp.getEmployeeId(), emp.getInputDate()).isPresent()) {\r\n                         Employee empFromDb = employeeRepo.findByEmployeeIdAndInputDate(emp.getEmployeeId(), emp.getInputDate()).get();\r\n                         empFromDb.setCommission(emp.getCommission());\r\n                         empFromDb.setName(emp.getName());\r\n                         employeeRepo.save(empFromDb);\r\n                     }\r\n\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput shown below\r\nHibernate: insert into employee (commission, name, version, employee_id, input_date) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: insert into employee (commission, name, version, employee_id, input_date) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: insert into employee (commission, name, version, employee_id, input_date) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\r\nHibernate: insert into employee (commission, name, version, employee_id, input_date) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\r\n2019-10-15 16:43:10.372  WARN 17216 --- [           main] o.h.engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper   : SQL Error: 1, SQLState: 23000\r\n2019-10-15 16:43:10.372 ERROR 17216 --- [           main] o.h.engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper   : ORA-00001: unique constraint (I706446.SYS_C008493) violated\r\n\r\nHibernate: select employee0_.employee_id as employee_id1_0_, employee0_.input_date as input_date2_0_, employee0_.commission as commission3_0_, employee0_.name as name4_0_, employee0_.version as version5_0_ from employee employee0_ where employee0_.employee_id=?

Its size can&#39;t be determined before launching the kernel that reads the input data. So I allocate data on the device during input processing.  \r\nHowever, trying to copy that data back to host fails. From what I could gather, this is because there is a limitation in CUDA that does not allow device-allocated memory to be accessed by the runtime API. That information, however, was for CUDA 4 with _&quot;a fix coming soon&quot;_. Does anyone know if that fix or a workaround ever came? I can&#39;t seem to find any recent information on this.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a reproducible example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;cstdio&gt;\r\n\r\n__device__ int *devData;\r\n\r\n__global__ void initKernel()\r\n{\r\n\tdevData = new int[6];\r\n\tdevData[0] = 0;\r\n\tdevData[1] = 1;\r\n\tdevData[2] = 2;\r\n\tdevData[3] = 3;\r\n\tdevData[4] = 4;\r\n\tdevData[5] = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\n__global__ void printKernel()\r\n{\r\n\tprintf(&quot;Testing device: %d\\n&quot;, devData[3]);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tinitKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;();\r\n\tcudaDeviceSynchronize();\r\n\t\r\n\tprintKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;();\r\n\tcudaDeviceSynchronize();\r\n\r\n\tint *devAddr;\r\n\tcudaGetSymbolAddress((void **)&amp;devAddr, devData);\r\n\r\n\tint *hostData = new int[6];\r\n\tcudaMemcpy(hostData, devAddr, 6*sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost)); //cudaErrorInvalidValue (invalid argument)\r\n\t//same error with: cudaMemcpyFromSymbol(hostData, devData, 6*sizeof(int));\r\n\t\r\n\tprintf(&quot;Testing host: %d\\n&quot;, testHost[3]);\r\n\t\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis throws a *cudaErrorInvalidValue* for cudaMemcpy (same for cudaMemcpyFromSymbol).

The following two are (essentially) the same:\r\n\r\n    var input;\r\n    var i = 0;\r\n    \r\n    for(; i &lt; input_selector.length; i++) input = input_selector[i];\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; input_selector.length; i++) var input = input_selector[i];\r\n\r\nboth create a variable named `input` in global scope, and then update that variable. That means that any functions that wants to read `input` later will just read the last version of `input`, and not the version at the time you defined the handler you would trigger later.\r\n\r\n`let`, however, is _block_ scoped, and your `for` loop is a block. So defining `let input` inside the `for` loop will mean that input is defined uniquely for every iteration of the loop, since every time the block gets executed a new scope is created for everything in there.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for `var i = 0` in your for loop - any handler that calls it later will just log the last global value of `i`, but if you use `let`, that&#39;s not the case and every iteration of the loop has its own `i`. So your code could simply be reduced to this:\r\n\r\n    const input_selector = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.coins_n&#39;);\r\n    const price_selector = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.price&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    for( let i = 0; i &lt; input_selector.length; i++ ){\r\n    \r\n        input_selector[i].addEventListener(&#39;input&#39;, event =&gt; {\r\n    \r\n            price_selector[i].innerHTML = event.target.value;\r\n    \r\n        });\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is pretty complex to explain once you start typing it out, so better read what other have already written at something like MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402473/passing-variables-through-addeventlistener/58403115#58403115","title":"Passing variables through addEventListener"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12222836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ee302385b9138fac98df7f9d4b873f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Muq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222836/muq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12222836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ee302385b9138fac98df7f9d4b873f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Muq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222836/muq"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58403115,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571176617,"creation_date":1571172663,"last_edit_date":1571174563,"question_id":58402473,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402473","body_markdown":"I am trying to add event to all inputs, get the value (number) from those and insertHtml them into span elements.\r\n\r\nThis is my javascript code.

After a few attempts, I was stumped, my small application was running but the file permissions were not changing. I copied and pasted the command into a terminal window to ensure I wasn&#39;t crazy and it changed the permissions as expected. I figured the next step was to print the return value of the `Process.Start()` method to ensure my command was successfully starting. This is where my confusion begins... When I added a `Console.WriteLine()` call to print the return value, all of the sudden the `chmod` command worked. I commented out the `Console.WriteLine()` and rebuilt the solution and it stopped working!!! \r\n\r\nMy questions are: What is going on behind the scenes? and why does printing the return of `Process.Start()` change its effect?\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```\r\n-rwx---rwx  1 myUser DOMAIN Users  6 Oct 15 13:01 hello.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 myUser DOMAIN Users  6 Oct 15 13:01 hello.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Diagnostics;\r\n\r\nnamespace Permission\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            RunLinuxCommand(&quot;chmod 777 /Users/myUser/Desktop/hello.txt&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static bool RunLinuxCommand(string command)\r\n        {\r\n            var startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo\r\n            {\r\n                FileName = &quot;/bin/bash&quot;,\r\n                // Escape double-quotes (&quot;)\r\n                Arguments = $&quot;-c \\&quot;{command.Replace(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;, &quot;\\\\\\&quot;&quot;)}\\&quot;&quot;,\r\n            };\r\n            \r\n            using (var proc = new Process())\r\n            {\r\n                proc.StartInfo = startInfo;\r\n                var ret = proc.Start();\r\n                // Comment out the following line and it doesn&#39;t work? \r\n                Console.WriteLine(ret);\r\n                return ret;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case it matters:\r\n\r\n.NET core 2.1\r\n\r\nMacOS 10.13.6","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402431/printing-process-start-return-changes-effect-of-command","title":"Printing Process.Start() return changes effect of command?"},{"tags":["android","android-studio","android-intent"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12222805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDGNozkwq-XGIxlNjRFLPiuuDbTtcdcWChlKl_N_Q=k-s128","display_name":"Miguel M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222805/miguel-m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2396,"user_id":539481,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/547216d430260884299bed09f012aeb1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Paweł Prażak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/539481/pawe%c5%82-pra%c5%bcak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571214929,"creation_date":1571172389,"last_edit_date":1571214929,"question_id":58402430,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402430","body_markdown":"So basically, I am trying to use searchview to find activities by &quot;tags&quot; given to these activities.

Please see the following screenshot and code example. My strategy is to wrap my text and the code for `actionLink` in the `HTML` function. This works well. However, the size of the icon is determined by the size of the associated. I would like to know if it is possible to make all the icons the same size, such as the smallest one associated with the `selectInput`? \r\n\r\nThe documentation (https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.0.1/icon.html) mentioned that it is to set `&quot;fa-3x&quot;` in the `icon` function to make the size to be 3 times as normal. But in my case the size would sill be determined by the associated text and each text has a different size. So I guess this strategy would not work. It would be great if anyone can share their ideas or suggestions. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    # Load the packages\r\n    library(shiny)\r\n    library(shinydashboard)\r\n    library(shinyalert)\r\n    \r\n    # User Interface\r\n    ui &lt;- dashboardPage(\r\n      header = dashboardHeader(title = &quot;&quot;),\r\n      sidebar = dashboardSidebar(\r\n        sidebarMenu(\r\n          menuItem(\r\n            text = &quot;Example&quot;,\r\n            tabName = &quot;tab1&quot;\r\n          )\r\n        )\r\n      ),\r\n      body = dashboardBody(\r\n        # A call to use the shinyalert package\r\n        useShinyalert(),\r\n        \r\n        tabItems(\r\n          tabItem(\r\n            tabName = &quot;tab1&quot;,\r\n            h2(HTML(&quot;This is a title&quot;,\r\n               as.character(actionLink(inputId = &quot;info1&quot;, \r\n                                       label = &quot;&quot;, \r\n                                       icon = icon(&quot;info&quot;))))),\r\n            fluidRow(\r\n              box(\r\n                title = HTML(&quot;This is the title of the box&quot;,\r\n                             as.character(actionLink(inputId = &quot;info2&quot;, \r\n                                                     label = &quot;&quot;, \r\n                                                     icon = icon(&quot;info&quot;)))), \r\n                status = &quot;primary&quot;, solidHeader = TRUE,\r\n                selectInput(inputId = &quot;Select&quot;, \r\n                            label = HTML(&quot;This is the title of the selectInput&quot;,\r\n                                         as.character(actionLink(inputId = &quot;info3&quot;, \r\n                                                                 label = &quot;&quot;, \r\n                                                                 icon = icon(&quot;info&quot;)))), \r\n                            choices = 1:3)\r\n              )\r\n            )\r\n          )\r\n        )\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    server &lt;- function(input, output, session){\r\n      observeEvent(input$info1, {\r\n        shinyalert(text = &quot;Info 1&quot;, type = &quot;info&quot;)\r\n      })\r\n      observeEvent(input$info2, {\r\n        shinyalert(text = &quot;Info 2&quot;, type = &quot;info&quot;)\r\n      })\r\n      observeEvent(input$info3, {\r\n        shinyalert(text = &quot;Info 3&quot;, type = &quot;info&quot;)\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    # Run the app\r\n    shinyApp(ui, server)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mXDCt.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402421/how-to-make-the-size-of-icon-consistent-when-using-shiny-and-shinydashboard","title":"How to make the size of icon consistent when using Shiny and Shinydashboard?"},{"tags":["gravity-forms-plugin"],"owner":{"reputation":287,"user_id":2924072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/446b25a7f7a41bec5f2b151810c0d8e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Student22","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2924072/student22"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571172310,"creation_date":1571172310,"question_id":58402413,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402413","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been using Gravity Forms with no problems for a while, but today I&#39;m receiving this error reading the following:\r\n\r\n`There was an issue creating your form.`\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of what the error looks like.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the *System Status* button to get more information, I see that the *Database* section has a red *x* reading the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe database is currently being upgraded to version 2.4.14.4.

One of the metrics that is used often is the event rate as a function of time. For example, measuring the sample-rate of some external asynchronous sensor.\r\n\r\nCurrently the way I&#39;m calculating the frequency of events like this is to keep a queue of event timestamps. When the event occurs we push a current timestamp onto the queue, then pop until the oldest timestamp is less than a predefined age. Then, the event frequency is proportional to the size of the queue. In pseudo-code the method usually looks something like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef on_event():\r\n    var now = current_time()\r\n    time_queue.push(now)\r\n\r\n    while((now - time_queue.front()) &gt; QUEUE_DEPTH_SECONDS):\r\n        time_queue.pop()\r\n\r\n    frequency = time_queue.size() / QUEUE_DEPTH_SECONDS\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this approach is obviously not optimal: \r\n\r\n1. Memory requirement and computation time is proportional to event rate.\r\n2. The queue duration has to be manually adjusted based on the expected data rate in order to tune low-frequency performance vs memory requirements. \r\n3. The response-time of the frequency measurement is also dependent on the queue duration. Longer durations  lower the response time of the calculation. \r\n4. The frequency is only updated when a new event occurs. If the events stop occurring, then the frequency measurement will remain at the value calculated when the last event was received. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m curious if there are any alternative algorithms that can be used to calculate the rate of an event, and what trade-offs they have in relation to computational complexity, space requirements, response-time, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402397/alternative-methods-of-computing-real-time-event-frequency","title":"Alternative methods of computing real-time event frequency"},{"tags":["wsdl","basic-authentication","delphi-xe8","smartcard-reader"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11377531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f9e5d410ff1081a2f1507fccfaaa6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carmelocony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377531/carmelocony"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571215519,"post_id":58402396,"comment_id":103162242,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402396/delphixe8-and-wsdl-disable-authentication-via-smart-card-reader#comment103162242_58402396"},{"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11377531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f9e5d410ff1081a2f1507fccfaaa6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carmelocony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377531/carmelocony"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571487523,"post_id":58402396,"comment_id":103262638,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402396/delphixe8-and-wsdl-disable-authentication-via-smart-card-reader#comment103262638_58402396"},{"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11377531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f9e5d410ff1081a2f1507fccfaaa6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carmelocony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377531/carmelocony"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571640854,"post_id":58402396,"comment_id":103294055,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58402396/delphixe8-and-wsdl-disable-authentication-via-smart-card-reader#comment103294055_58402396"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11377531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f9e5d410ff1081a2f1507fccfaaa6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carmelocony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377531/carmelocony"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32,"user_id":11377531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f9e5d410ff1081a2f1507fccfaaa6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"carmelocony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377531/carmelocony"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571325120,"creation_date":1571172232,"last_edit_date":1571325120,"question_id":58402396,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58402396","body_markdown":"With Delphi XE8 I imported a WSDL and use the HTTPRIO component\r\nFor use authentication:\r\n\r\n\r\n    property HTTPRIO:\r\n      HTTPWebNode -&gt;\r\n        ClientCertificate -&gt;
