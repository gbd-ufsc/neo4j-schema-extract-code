But your calls are not to tasks but to your `const browserSync = require(&#39;browser-sync)` package.\r\n\r\nSo it is confusing and will probably lead to errors to use the same identifier - `browserSync` for **both** your package require name and the task name as it appears you did.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen here:\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;browserSync&#39;, function() {\r\n      browserSync({\r\n        server: {\r\n          baseDir: &#39;app&#39;\r\n        },\r\n          browser: &#39;Chrome&#39;\r\n      })\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThe first use of `browserSync` is as a task name.  The second, in the function body, is a reference to the package name.  And the second is ultimately the one used in your `watch` tasks and would not be quoted there because it is not a task name.  So using `browserSync` both ways is definitely confusing - just pick a different name for one like:\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;bSync&#39;, function() {\r\n      browserSync.init({......\r\n\r\nAlso note the `init` added to the above code.

Each visitor gets &quot;Token&quot; which is unique value to them and is used to track their actions on the site.\r\n\r\nI wanted to show owners of the site actions of their visitors so I wrote following query. All the visits are stored in &quot;custom_logs&quot; table.\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM custom_logs\r\n    WHERE pn = &#39;pn-9283896662&#39; AND\r\n          id IN (SELECT MAX(id)\r\n                 FROM custom_logs\r\n                 WHERE action_clicked_text LIKE &#39;%sometext%&#39;  \r\n                 GROUP BY token\r\n               )\r\n          AND token != &#39;&#39; AND\r\n          action_timestamp &gt; 11568 AND\r\n          action_timestamp &lt; 1570846368\r\n     order by action_timestamp desc\r\n     LIMIT 0, 30;\r\n\r\nI narrowed the problem to &quot;GROUP BY token&quot; part of the query. When I remove this part query runs way faster, but still pretty slow (0.7s compared to 5s with Group By part), and there are 4 of those queries in one page. In custom_logs table there is already like 250 000 rows.\r\n\r\n&quot;GROUP BY token&quot; part is there because I want to show people only one and only newest log of each user so they can click on it and see the complete logs of said user. So after the query I use `mysqli_num_rows($results);` to count the results. Is there any other way besides caching to quickly count all the results?\r\n\r\nI read something about indexing columns so I made token varchar(255) and made it indexed but it did nothing in terms of speed.

The top of the stack (i.e. the last value in the `stack` list) is the rightmost character that is currently unbalanced (or a special index of `-1` that refers to a position &quot;before the beginning&quot; of the string if there are not any unbalanced characters currently).\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the stack is the index of the rightmost unbalanced `)` character, or `-1` if there has been no unbalanced `)`s seen so far. All of the other values in the stack will always be indexes of so-far unbalanced `(` characters. We might balance them later, as we continue to iterate over the string.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to a new character in our iteration over the input string, there are three possible actions we might take.\r\n\r\n1. If the new character is a `(`, we know it is unbalanced (for now, since it&#39;s the last character we&#39;ve processed), so we always push it onto top of the stack.\r\n\r\nIn the other two cases, the new character is `)`. For both, we want to pop a value off the top of the stack, since the former value is no longer the rightmost unbalanced character.\r\n\r\n2. If the stack is not empty after we pop a value, then the popped index represented an unbalanced `(` character, and the current `)` has just balanced it.\r\n\r\n In this case, our current character is part of a balanced substring, so we check if it&#39;s the longest such substring we&#39;ve seen so far. The last value in the stack is the index of the rightmost unbalanced character, and our balanced substring begins just to its right. The length of the current substring is thus `i - stack[-1]`, and the `max` call will replace `a` (the length of the longest substring seen previously) with this new length if it&#39;s larger than `a`&#39;s old value.\r\n\r\n3. If the stack is empty after we popped a value, then the value we popped was the bottom of the stack. As I mentioned above, the bottom value is an index of an unbalanced `)` character (or `-1` representing the start of the string). If we&#39;ve popped it, that means our current `)` is unbalanced! In this case, we replace the popped value with our own index. This is the new bottom of the stack, the index of the a new rightmost unbalanced `)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513499/how-to-better-understand-for-longest-valid-parentheses-problem-solution/58519206#58519206","title":"How to better understand for &quot;longest valid parentheses&quot; problem solution?"}],"owner":{"reputation":220,"user_id":7934881,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aa6f4cdaa2a06c9ed371c080ee77dbb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ayumu Kasugano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7934881/ayumu-kasugano"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571821460,"creation_date":1571786628,"last_edit_date":1571786971,"question_id":58513499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58513499","body_markdown":"The problem is:\r\n\r\n&gt; Given a string containing just the characters &#39;(&#39; and &#39;)&#39;, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring\r\n\r\nSome examples are:\r\n\r\n&gt; Input: &quot;(()&quot;, output: 2\r\n\r\n&gt; Input: &quot;)()())&quot;, output 4\r\n\r\nI found this working Python solution below:\r\n\r\n    def solution(s):\r\n        if not s or len(s) == 1:\r\n            return 0\r\n        \r\n        stack = [-1]\r\n        a = 0\r\n        for i,c in enumerate(s):\r\n            if c == &#39;(&#39;:\r\n                stack.append(i)\r\n            else:\r\n                stack.pop()\r\n                if stack:\r\n                    a = max(a, i - stack[-1])\r\n                else:\r\n                    stack.append(i) \r\n        return a\r\n\r\nI&#39;m having trouble understanding why this solution works.

ABI stability for Swift is about compiling source code into binary files with a common interface over several versions of the language. Without an ABI stability, the binary files across versions of the language, are incompatible with each other, because their formats differ. Dynamic libraries, for instance, have a static call table. As quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface): &quot;An ABI defines how data structures or computational routines are accessed in machine code&quot;. An ABI stability ensures that the library and caller (the app) use the same binary protocol for invoking functions, even if not compiled for the same version of the language.\r\n\r\nFor Swift&#39;s purpose, an ABI stability will allow developers to switch to newer versions of the language, without updating their libraries/frameworks, that way taking advantage of the newer features of the language without waiting for the libraries to get updated. From [a Swift.org article back in February](https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-more/): &quot;Today, when a Swift library changes, any apps using that library have to be recompiled.&quot; Again, from that article:\r\n\r\n&gt; ABI stability for Apple OSes means that apps deploying to upcoming releases of those OSes will no longer need to embed the Swift standard library and “overlay” libraries within the app bundle, shrinking their download size; the Swift runtime and standard library will be shipped with the OS, like the Objective-C runtime.\r\n\r\nFor you as a developer, ABI stability in Swift, means more compatibility with libraries. Due to the Swift language developers needing to ensure that the ABI stability doesn&#39;t break, the rate of addition of new features will drop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513461/where-exactly-is-the-issue-with-abi-stability-in-swift-programming/58514107#58514107","title":"Where exactly is the issue with ABI stability in Swift programming"}],"owner":{"reputation":3238,"user_id":870565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/86wGY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pnizzle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870565/pnizzle"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571795047,"creation_date":1571786321,"question_id":58513461,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58513461","body_markdown":"First of all, I&#39;ve been an `Objective C` developer for years, and around the time that Swift was announced I was mostly maintaining existing `Obj C` projects. The chance never came to be fully invested in a `Swift` app, whether from scratch or to maintain. My efforts where directed mostly towards .Net and React Native at that time.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve done research on [what ABI is][1]. It&#39;s all fine and dandy. From that answer, I can only assume how that comes into play for `Swift`, since I do not have much heavy involvement with `Swift`.\r\n\r\nSo, from simply guessing, is all the ruckus, racket, and fracas in `Swift ABI` talk to do with the &#39;assumed&#39; fact that when a library is written/compiled with version `1.0` of `Swift` (before Swift 5), it will work fine with an app written in `1.0`. When the next version of that library is written in `Swift 2.0`, that aforementioned app written in `Swift 1.0` will not be able to use it, unless compiled for `Swift 2.0`? Assuming that I am correct on that one, what if I have an app written in `Swift 4`, and the library I wish to use was written in `Swift 1.0` Can I use it? With `Swift 5` now released, are `ABI` issues now resolved for `Swift` libraries and apps `5+`, and not `5+` interacting with `5-` ? \r\n\r\nIf I had experienced these issues first hand I might have had a better understanding of Swift ABI issues. \r\n\r\nPlease explain with actual examples that cover the full range of cases (if possible).\r\n\r\n**Update**: please include if there are any issues with ABI for small version increases eg from swift 4.0 to 4.1\r\n\r\n  [1]:

For the latter purpose, I followed the code shown at &lt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/converters/jsonl2json.py&gt; with a couple of notable differences. The _cleanup_spans() function is identical to the one in the example. I did not use the minibatch() but made a separate doc for each of my labeled annotations. Also, (perhaps critically?) I found that using the sentencizer ruined many of my annotations, possibly because the spans get shifted in a way that the _cleanup_spans() function fails to repair properly. Removing the sentencizer causes the docs_to_json() function to throw an error. In my function (unlike in the linked example) I therefore run the sentencizer on each doc *after* the entities are written to them, which preserves my annotations properly and allows the docs_to_json() function to run without complaints.  \r\n\r\nThe function load_jsonl called within import_from_doccano() is defined as:\r\n\r\n    def load_jsonl(input_path):     \r\n        data = []     \r\n        with open(input_path, &#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as f:     \r\n            for line in f:     \r\n                data.append(json.loads(line.replace(&#39;\\n|\\r&#39;,&#39;&#39;), strict=False))     \r\n        print(&#39;Loaded {} records from {}&#39;.format(len(data), input_path))     \r\n        print()     \r\n        return data \r\n\r\nMy annotations are each of length ~10000 characters or less.

It&#39;s a solo project and I&#39;m an hardware engineer, so I prefer CNNs already quantized  and possibly documented weights format that do not require much reverse engineering. The idea is to access already quantized and well known CNNs rather than going to the process itself.\r\n\r\nThe architecture exploits weight sparsity at the level of their bit representation. Weights are sparsified further (at bit level) with a lossless transformation. The architecture skips from one non zero bit to the next per clock cycle. It essentially takes one clock cycle per every non zero bit in the weights to perform a tensor product and it uses only +/- accumulators rather than larger multiply accumulators (MACs). This works quite well because CNN weights tend to have a Laplacian/Gaussian type of distribution and they are very sparse at bit level.\r\nThis also allows for arbitrary precision weights and even floating points (fps are, up to a scaling factor, just large and very sparse integers with only a few non zero bits).\r\nAnother advantage is that weights are highly compressible and decompressed on the fly.\r\n\r\nI have previously quantized CNNs with with [Pyramid Vector Quantization][1] (PVQ) myself. This is because you can [avoid multiplications in dot products][2] with a PVQed vector. I have then moved on to the current architecture and [here][3] are two examples of performance analysis on an FIR filter and the Tiny Yolo v3 CNN.\r\nHowever, I&#39;d like more data points before I publish more details about this.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2270521\r\n  [2]: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/convolutions-without-multiplications-efficient-cnns-vincenzo-liguori\r\n  [3]: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cnns-inference-fir-filters-without-multipliers-two-examples-liguori","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513441/quantized-cnn-examples-for-my-neural-processor","title":"Quantized CNN examples for my neural processor"},{"tags":["json","go"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786456,"post_id":58513435,"comment_id":103354178,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go#comment103354178_58513435"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":7196097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5SPt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rakshith Jk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7196097/rakshith-jk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786661,"post_id":58513435,"comment_id":103354225,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go#comment103354225_58513435"},{"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571787028,"post_id":58513435,"comment_id":103354306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go#comment103354306_58513435"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":7196097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5SPt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rakshith Jk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7196097/rakshith-jk"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571787235,"post_id":58513435,"comment_id":103354338,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go#comment103354338_58513435"},{"owner":{"reputation":23213,"user_id":7426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a562698800b535e47b68590f63c402a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7426/adrian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571837450,"post_id":58513435,"comment_id":103373036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go#comment103373036_58513435"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":7196097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5SPt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rakshith Jk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7196097/rakshith-jk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571787673,"post_id":58513587,"comment_id":103354426,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513435/converting-string-to-json-in-go/58513587#comment103354426_58513587"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65059,"user_id":5728991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxuro.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cerise Lim&#243;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5728991/cerise-lim%c3%b3n"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571787714,"last_edit_date":1571787714,"creation_date":1571787436,"answer_id":58513587,"question_id":58513435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513587","body_markdown":"The problem is that the response content-type header is not application/json.

I understand that LUT works well because it has a gradient of colors that you can source from, unlike my example which has very discrete values.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513424/smoothing-jagged-pixels-when-replacing-texture-colors-with-nearest-filtering","title":"Smoothing jagged pixels when replacing texture colors with nearest filtering"},{"tags":["c#","math","return","return-value"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786213,"post_id":58513423,"comment_id":103354131,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513423/logical-error-in-display-math-not-displaying-initial-result#comment103354131_58513423"},{"owner":{"reputation":8928,"user_id":8967612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3acd197eb34e7542441e294bc099c375?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ahmed Abdelhameed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8967612/ahmed-abdelhameed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786289,"post_id":58513423,"comment_id":103354149,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513423/logical-error-in-display-math-not-displaying-initial-result#comment103354149_58513423"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12081951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfd45ee59d5db5370f552952c5ab5663?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eysaak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081951/eysaak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786447,"post_id":58513423,"comment_id":103354175,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513423/logical-error-in-display-math-not-displaying-initial-result#comment103354175_58513423"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8928,"user_id":8967612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3acd197eb34e7542441e294bc099c375?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ahmed Abdelhameed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8967612/ahmed-abdelhameed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8928,"user_id":8967612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3acd197eb34e7542441e294bc099c375?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ahmed Abdelhameed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8967612/ahmed-abdelhameed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571787366,"last_edit_date":1571787366,"creation_date":1571786662,"answer_id":58513504,"question_id":58513423,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513504","body_markdown":"If I understand your problem correctly, your code should look something like this:\r\n\r\n    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        double startingPop;\r\n        double increasePer;\r\n        double numDays;\r\n        \r\n        const int INTERVAL = 1;\r\n        \r\n        if (double.TryParse(textBox1.Text, out startingPop) &amp;&amp;\r\n            double.TryParse(textBox2.Text, out increasePer) &amp;&amp;\r\n            double.TryParse(textBox3.Text, out numDays))\r\n        {\r\n            Results.Items.Add(&quot;On the first day, the amount of organisms is &quot; + startingPop);\r\n\r\n            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numDays; i += INTERVAL)\r\n            {\r\n                startingPop = (startingPop * (increasePer / 100) + startingPop);\r\n                Results.Items.Add(&quot;After &quot; + i + &quot; day(s), the amount of organisms is &quot; + startingPop);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe changes I made to the code:\r\n\r\n- Combine the three `if` statements into one using the [`&amp;&amp;`][1] operator.\r\n- Print the population value _before increasing it_ so that the next displayed value (which reads _&quot;after 1 day&quot;_) will be the next incremented value.\r\n- To make your result items grammatically correct, you may the second line inside the loop with something like:\r\n\r\n        string s = (i &gt; 1 ?

assume that we have a dictionary whose keys are the food names. \r\n\r\nA user can input a food name string (i.e. &quot;banana yogurt steak cheese cake&quot;), and for the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s assume that everything is lower-case, and no food name appears more than once in the string.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the most efficient way to find out what keys from the dictionary appeared in the food name string? Let&#39;s assume that it&#39;s possible that no key appears at all, and it&#39;s also possible that food name string only consists of the dictionary keys. \r\n\r\nThis is for self-study purpose. Use of **Suffix Trie** seems to be a good option, but I&#39;m not sure how to optimize it (since there are possibly multiple matches in this case) If there are well-known theorems or references for it, i would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS.

My compliments to the chef.\r\nUnfortunately, I was arrested by the officer for not paying my bill.\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nclams  [5]\r\n   is  [2]\r\n chef  [5]\r\n ever  [5]\r\n   at  [2]\r\n have  [5]\r\ntable  [4]\r\n your  [2]\r\n best  [5]\r\n  sir  [3]\r\n said  [1, 3, 5]\r\n  for  [6]\r\n  boy  [3]\r\n when  [4]\r\n   by  [6]\r\n   to  [1, 2, 4, 5]\r\n  way  [2]\r\n  was  [4, 6]\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nL08-8)  (5 points)\r\nSame code as above, but words in the concordance should be sorted when you print them.\r\n\r\n I have this so far, but it gives me the number of times the word appears not the line numbers.\r\n\r\nPython Code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef main():\r\n   &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n       Main function\r\n   &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n   try:\r\n       # Opening file for reading\r\n       fp = open(&quot;d:\\Python\\input.txt&quot;);\r\n      \r\n       # Dictionary to hold words and their frequencies\r\n       wordDict = {};\r\n      \r\n       # Reading data line by line\r\n       for line in fp:\r\n           # Splitting words on space\r\n           words = line.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n          \r\n           # Looping over each word in words\r\n           for word in words:\r\n              \r\n               # Considering only the words with length at-least 1\r\n               if len(word) &gt; 0:\r\n                   # Converting to lower case\r\n                   word = word.lower();\r\n                  \r\n                   # Checking for existence of key in dict\r\n                   if word in wordDict.keys():\r\n                       # If already present, just update frequency\r\n                       wordDict[word] += 1;\r\n                   else:\r\n                       # If new word, updating existing value\r\n                       wordDict[word] = 1;\r\n      \r\n       # Closing file\r\n       fp.close();\r\n      \r\n       # Looping over sorted keys of dictionary\r\n       for key in sorted(wordDict):\r\n           # Printing word frequency values\r\n           print(&quot; {0} : {1} &quot;.format(key, wordDict[key]));\r\n      \r\n   except Exception as ex:\r\n       # Handling exceptions\r\n       print(ex);\r\n      \r\n# Calling main function      \r\nmain();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513395/concordance-with-line-numbers","title":"Concordance with line numbers"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","matplotlib","seaborn"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":172114,"user_id":4124317,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wsHAV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ImportanceOfBeingErnest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4124317/importanceofbeingernest"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786926,"post_id":58513394,"comment_id":103354282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513394/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-robust-series-of-boxplots-from-preprocessed-data#comment103354282_58513394"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":8711059,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8955f1f333ce3b7484d09defc9e8f211?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LongStreak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8711059/longstreak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":112790,"user_id":6622587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAYS0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"eyllanesc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622587/eyllanesc"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571787759,"creation_date":1571785734,"last_edit_date":1571787759,"question_id":58513394,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58513394","body_markdown":"Basically, I cannot find a solution to this problem.\r\nI have examined the documentation for Matplotlib, Pandas and seaborn to find a way to plot, on one set of axes, a graph showing boxplots(UQ, LQ, Mean etc.) for groups of data using pre-calculated sequence data, in .tsv form in the style of a FastQC report, here for example:\r\nhttps://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/per_base_quality.png\r\n```\r\n#Position\tMean\tMedian\tLower Quartile\tUpper Quartile\t10th Percentile\t90th Percentile\r\n...\r\n10\t40.1102169515942\t41.0\t41.0\t41.0\t37.0\t41.0\r\n11\t40.14826572575025\t41.0\t41.0\t41.0\t37.0\t41.0\r\n12\t40.12512352866827\t41.0\t41.0\t41.0\t37.0\t41.0\r\n13\t40.069397493337185\t41.0\t41.0\t41.0\t37.0\t41.0\r\n...\r\n```\r\netc.\r\nThe closest thing I have found to plotting this is a function in matplotlib called https://matplotlib.org/gallery/statistics/bxp.html, which I found in a previous answer on the question https://stackoverflow.com/q/23655798/8711059,\r\nhowever I am not sure if this would allow multiple plots on the same axes.

following issue occurs while running on Tomcat 8.5 with Java 10. It&#39;s hard to summarize because the behavior I&#39;m observing makes no sense. \r\n\r\nI have a keystore:\r\n\r\n    InputStream in = new FileInputStream(KEYSTORE_PATH);\r\n    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());\r\n\r\nWhich I access using:\r\n\r\n    ks.load(in, PASSWORD);\r\n\r\nwhere PASSWORD is a char[]\r\n\r\nI store the the password in the DB, using an encrypted form. \r\n\r\nSince I&#39;m having issues shown in Ex. 1 and Ex. 2, I replaced the encrypted password with the non-encrypted form, temporarily, since KeyStore.load requires a non-encrypted password. \r\n\r\nks.load() works correctly when I retrieve the non-encrypted password from the DB using a Subclass of Properties,.\r\n\r\nBut the following do not work, assume password is P@ssw0rd:\r\n\r\nEx. 1\r\n\r\n    String = &quot;P@ssw0rd&quot;\r\n    ks.load(in, pwd.toCharArray());\r\n\r\nEx. 2\r\n\r\n    char[] pwd = new char[] {&#39;P&#39;,&#39;@&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;d&#39;};\r\n    ks.load(in, pwd);\r\n\r\nIf I run Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 test in a main method, then I do not get any errors. \r\n\r\nSo using a DB value as is works fine, if the value is not encrypted. Ultimately, this value will be encrypted, so then I need to get the decrypted string. But as shown in Ex. 1 and Ex. 2, passing anything other the original DB value into KeyStore.load is throwing an error, this would be the decrypted password.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can see what mistake I&#39;m making or point out something else I can try. \r\n\r\nException:\r\n\r\n    java.io.IOException: keystore password was incorrect\r\n        at java.base/sun.security.pkcs12.PKCS12KeyStore.engineLoad(PKCS12KeyStore.java:2097)\r\n        at java.base/sun.security.util.KeyStoreDelegator.engineLoad(KeyStoreDelegator.java:243)\r\n        at java.base/java.security.KeyStore.load(KeyStore.java:1479)\r\n        at org.springframework.security.saml.key.JKSKeyManager.initialize(JKSKeyManager.java:117)\r\n        ... 124 more\r\n    Caused by: java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: failed to decrypt safe contents entry: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded.

Instead of `VLOOKUP`, it uses `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=INDEX([XR.xlsx]Sheet1!$C$2:$C$18,MATCH(1,(B2&gt;=[XR.xlsx]Sheet1!$A$2:$A$18)*(B2&lt;=[XR.xlsx]Sheet1!$B$2:$B$18),0),1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the business date (cell `B2`) is compared against both start and end date, the results are multiplied (equivalent to logical AND) and matched against 1 (i.e. TRUE).\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: After pasting this formula (e.g. into formula bar for cell `C2`) you need to hit `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` instead of the usual `Enter`. This is to indicate a so-called &quot;array formula&quot; (aka CSE formula); otherwise, our comparisons inside MATCH wouldn&#39;t work as intended. You may refer to [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/674566/when-to-use-ctrlshiftenter-and-when-to-use-enter-in-excel) for more info. The CSE formulas show surrounded by braces in the formula bar.

Because of the initial `direction` key the JSON effectively has 3 (or at least 2.5!) layers of nesting.  This will either need to be flattened in `init(from:)` or, as in the below, need a temporary struct for ease of mapping.

CodingKeys, while obvious, isn&#39;t defined in the previous answers, so will cause errors compiling the init(from:) \r\n4. there&#39;s no `stopTitle` field in the JSON, so that will error on decoding unless it is treated as an optional.

My model looks like this for the &quot;direction&quot; and &quot;prediction&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct BTDirection: Codable {\r\n    let title: String!\r\n    let stopTitle: String!\r\n    let prediction: [BTPrediction]!\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct BTPrediction: Codable {\r\n    let minutes: String!\r\n    let vehicle: String!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically what is happening is `prediction` in `BTDirection` is looking for an Array of BTPrediction, however in the 2nd case above, this wouldn&#39;t be an Array so the decoding fails. How can I make my models more flexible to accommodate both an array or a single object? Ideally, in the 2nd case `prediction` would still be an array of a single `BTDirection`. Any help on this would be much appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513344/how-to-make-swift-codable-types-more-versatile","title":"How to make Swift Codable types more versatile"},{"tags":["javascript","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28354,"user_id":2300597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBo7Q.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"peter.petrov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2300597/peter-petrov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786058,"post_id":58513343,"comment_id":103354087,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513343/html-canvas-gun-function#comment103354087_58513343"},{"owner":{"reputation":702,"user_id":4861760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0WHCI8o4R6E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEk/90zE1xvgabY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"KostasX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4861760/kostasx"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571786678,"post_id":58513343,"comment_id":103354232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513343/html-canvas-gun-function#comment103354232_58513343"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12254613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b8757f1fed203cb473db503f0c2a545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks909","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12254613/tmanrocks909"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571838559,"post_id":58513454,"comment_id":103373679,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513343/html-canvas-gun-function/58513454#comment103373679_58513454"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12254613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b8757f1fed203cb473db503f0c2a545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tmanrocks909","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12254613/tmanrocks909"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571840982,"post_id":58513454,"comment_id":103375190,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513343/html-canvas-gun-function/58513454#comment103375190_58513454"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":702,"user_id":4861760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0WHCI8o4R6E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEk/90zE1xvgabY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"KostasX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4861760/kostasx"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571786266,"creation_date":1571786266,"answer_id":58513454,"question_id":58513343,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513454","body_markdown":"Take a look at this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;
