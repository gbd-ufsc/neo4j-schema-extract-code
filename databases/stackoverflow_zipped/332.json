I tried different ways to reach it, but unfortunately it always seems to occur the same problem. I read in the Android documentation that webview.loadURL() works asynchronous. So that means, the WebView is running in its own Thread. What happens ist, that the UI-Thread will procees further in the Java code and returns nothing, because the WebView-Thread is still working. To block the UI-Thread does not work, because the WebView thread will also be blocked then ([read here][1]).\r\n\r\nSo I tried the way the documentation showed me and ended up with this:\r\n\r\n    String getJavascriptVariable(final String command) {\r\n        this.webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {\r\n                if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {\r\n                    webView.evaluateJavascript(command + &quot;;&quot;, new ValueCallback&lt;String&gt;() {\r\n                        @Override\r\n                        public void onReceiveValue(String s){tempVar = s;}\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        return tempVar;\r\n    }\r\n\r\ntempVar is a static Variable in the same class.

assignin(&#39;caller&#39;,&#39;fh&#39;,fh)\r\n    end\r\n\r\nthen call\r\n\r\n    m = minRand2(2)\r\n\r\nExample with the naming convention proposed in the question:\r\n\r\n    test1 \r\n\r\n    function m = test1\r\n        test2\r\n        disp(name_var_a);\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    function test2\r\n        eval([&#39;value_a = &quot;I am a string&quot;;&#39;]);\r\n        assignin(&#39;caller&#39;,&#39;name_var_a&#39;, value_a)\r\n    end\r\n\r\nCalling `test1` gives:\r\n\r\n    I am a string\r\n\r\nYou can use `evalin` too.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

want in matlab dynamically initialize a variable. I need that because I want the user to define arbitary much constants and a formula that calculates that.

I have a formula, that is applied on the formula of the user and of the result I have a differential equation which I want to solve. I have a working program but it&#39;s very slow.\r\n\r\nI tried to give the constants to the function that is put inside the differential equation and that works.

guess is that `outputTextDisplay` is an IBOutlet in `InOutViewController`, and it is declared as implicitly unwrapped. (Something like this: )\r\n\r\n    var outputTextDisplay: UITextField!\r\n\r\nIf you reference such a variable from one of the IBActions in your `InOutViewController`, all is well because at that point your view controller&#39;s views are loaded.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, you call `updateOutputText()` from another view controller, your `InOutViewController`&#39;s views may not have been loaded yet, so the outlet for outputTextDisplay is still nil. When a variable is declared as implicitly unwrapped (using a `!` at the end of the type) then any time you reference it, the compiler force-unwraps it, and if it&#39;s nil, you crash.\r\n\r\nYou should change your `updateOutputText()` to use `?` to unwrap the variable. That stops implicitly unwrapped optionals from crashing. Something like this:\r\n\r\n    func updateOutputText() {\r\n        // derive output file path and name from input if no output location is chosen \r\n        if inputFileUrl != nil &amp;&amp; outputDirectoryUrl == nil {\r\n            let outputDirectory = inputFileUrl!.deletingPathExtension()\r\n            let outputDirectoryPath = outputDirectory.path\r\n            let outputPath = outputDirectoryPath + &quot;(outputExtension)&quot;\r\n            outputTextDisplay?.stringValue = outputPath //Note the `?`\r\n        } else if inputFileUrl != nil &amp;&amp; outputDirectoryUrl != nil {\r\n         // derive default file name from input but use selected output path if one is chosen\r\n            let outputDirectoryPath = outputDirectoryUrl!.path\r\n            let outputFile = inputFileUrl!.deletingPathExtension()\r\n            let outputFilename = outputFile.lastPathComponent\r\n            // derive file extension from getOutputOption method of OptionsViewController class\r\n            let outputPath = outputDirectoryPath + &quot;/&quot; + outputFilename + &quot;(outputExtension)&quot;\r\n            outputTextDisplay?.stringValue = outputPath  //Note the `?`\r\n           }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe code `outputTextDisplay?.stringValue = outputPath` uses &quot;optional chaining&quot;, which causes the compiler to check if `outputTextDisplay` is nil, and stop executing the code if it is.\r\n\r\nNote that if you make that change, your string value won&#39;t get installed into your `outputTextDisplay` field when you call the `updateOutputText()` function. You&#39;ll need to install the value after `viewDidLoad()` is called. (Perhaps in your viewDidLoad or in viewWillAppear.)\r\n\r\n##Edit:\r\n\r\nThis code:\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func radioButtonClicked(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        getOutputOption()\r\n            // update display with new file extension\r\n        InOutViewController().updateOutputText()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs very wrong. In response to the user clicking a radio button, the `InOutViewController()` bit creates a throw-away instance of an `InOutViewController`, tries to call its `updateOutputText()` method, and then forgets about the newly created `InOutViewController`. Don&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\nYou need a way to keep track fo the child view controllers that are on-screen. To show you how to do that you&#39;ll need to explain how your various view controllers are being created. Are you using embed segues?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459129/xcode-finding-a-nil-variable-where-none-should-be-when-methods-is-called-from-an/58459293#58459293","title":"Xcode finding a nil variable where none should be when methods is called from another ViewController class"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12199136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ulNbJnW3_sk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd6qTXmsaKMz4w6aA--Dcql8_G8PA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"NCrusher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199136/ncrusher"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12199136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ulNbJnW3_sk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd6qTXmsaKMz4w6aA--Dcql8_G8PA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"NCrusher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199136/ncrusher"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58459293,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571572015,"creation_date":1571440119,"last_edit_date":1571441927,"question_id":58459129,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58459129","body_markdown":"I got midway through creating a MacOS app (my first app ever that isn&#39;t part of a &quot;Your First App&quot;

It is a communication protocol. It does not preclude you from having a shared storage. See above.\r\n\r\nZFS does not come with the ability of shared storage included, so you are basically down to the following choices:\r\n\r\n 1. Which underlying filesystem? \r\n 2. Do I want to offer an additional access mode via (S)FTP(S)?\r\n 3. How do I make my filesystem available across multiple servers? GlusterFS, CIFS or NFS?\r\n\r\nSo, let us walk this through.\r\n\r\n# Filesystem\r\n\r\nI know ZFS is intriguing, but here is the thing: xfs for example already has a maximum filesystem size of 8 exbibytes minus one byte. The specialist term for this is &quot;a s...load&quot;. To give you a relation: The library of congress holds about 20TB of digital media - and would fit into that roughly 400k times. Even good ol&#39; ext4 can hold 50k LoCs. And if you hold that much data, your FS is your smallest concern. Building the next couple of power plants to keep your stuff going presumably is.\r\n\r\n**Gist** Nice to think about, but use whatever you feel comfortable with. I personally use xfs (on LVM) for pretty much everything.\r\n\r\n# Additional access methods\r\n\r\nSure, why not? Aside from the security nightmare (privilege escalation, anyone?). And ProFTPd, with it&#39;s in build coffee machine and kitchen sink is the *last* FTP server I would use for anything. It has a ginormous code base, which lends itself to [accidentally introducing vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/16873/Proftpd-Proftpd.html?vendor_id=9520).\r\n\r\nBasically it boils down to the skills present in the project. Can you guys ***properly*** harden a system and an FTP server and ***monitor*** it for security incidents? Unless your answer is a confident &quot;Yes, ofc, plenty with experience with it!&quot; you should minimize the attack surface you present.\r\n\r\n**Gist** Don&#39;t, unless you really know what you are doing. And if you have to ask, you probably do not. No offense intended, just stating facts.\r\n\r\n# Shared filesystem\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have made... less than perfect experiences with GlusterFS. The replication has quite some requirements when it comes to network latency and stuff. In a nutshell: if we are talking of multiple availability zones, say EMEA, APAC and NCSA, it is close to impossible. You&#39;d be stuck to [georeplication](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Geo%20Replication/), which is less than ideal for the use case you describe.\r\n\r\nNFS and CIFS on the other hand have the problem that there is no replication at all, and all clients need to access the same server instance in order to access the data - hardly a good idea if you think you need an underlying ZFS to get along.\r\n\r\n**Gist** Shared filesystems at a global scale with halfway decent replication lags and access times are ***very*** hard to do and can get ***very*** expensive.\r\n\r\n# Haha, Smartypants, so what would you suggest?\r\n\r\nScale. Slowly. In the beginning, you should be able to get along with a simple FS based repository for your files. And then check various other means for large scale shared storage and migrate to it.\r\n\r\nTaking the turn towards implementation, I would even go a step further, you should make your storage an interface:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// Storer takes the source and stores its contents under path for further reading via\r\n// Retriever.\r\ntype Storer interface {\r\n\tStreamTo(path string, source io.Reader) (err error)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Retriever takes a path and streams the file it has stored under path to w.\r\ntype Retriever interface {\r\n\tStreamFrom(path string, w io.Writer) (err error)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Repository is a composite interface. It requires a\r\n// repository to accept andf provide streams of files\r\ntype Repository interface {\r\n\tStorer\r\n\tRetriever\r\n\tClose() error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you can implement various storage methods quite easily:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// FileStore represents a filesystem based file Repository.\r\ntype FileStore struct {\r\n\tbasepath string\r\n}\r\n\r\n// StreamFrom statisfies the Retriever interface.\r\nfunc (s *FileStore) StreamFrom(path string, w io.Writer) (err error) {\r\n\r\n\tf, err := os.OpenFile(filepath.Join(s.basepath, path), os.O_RDONLY|os.O_EXCL, 0640)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn handleErr(path, err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tdefer f.Close()\r\n\t_, err = io.Copy(w, f)\r\n\treturn err\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think this would be a great use case for [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/), which, despite its name is not a filesystem, but a feature of MongoDB. As for the reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. MongoDB comes with a concept called replica sets to ensure availability with transparent automatic failover between servers\r\n 2. It comes with a rather simple mechanism of automatic data partitioning, called a sharded cluster\r\n 3. It comes with an indefinite number of access gateways called `mongos` query routers to access your sharded data.\r\n 4. For the client, aside from the connection URL, all this is transparent. So it does not make a difference (almost, aside from [read preference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/) and [write concern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-write-concern/)) whether it&#39;s storage backend consists of a single server or a globally replicated sharded cluster with 600 nodes.\r\n 5. If done properly, there is not a single point of failure, you can replicate across availability zones while keeping the &quot;hot&quot; data close to the respective users.\r\n\r\nI have created a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mwmahlberg/gridfileserv) which contains an example of the interface suggestion and implements a filesystem based repository as well as a MongoDB repository. You might want to have a look at it. It lacks caching at the moment. In case you would like to see that implemented, please open an issue there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459117/how-to-handle-video-and-image-upload-to-storage-servers/58468306#58468306","title":"How to handle video and image upload to storage servers?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12240873,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b977a4cd4ebebc87e884bcf807b40323?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240873/martin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":4,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571522265,"creation_date":1571440014,"question_id":58459117,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58459117","body_markdown":"I am in the process of developing an application (in Go or possibly in PHP) where users needs to upload photos and images. \r\n\r\nI have setup up a couple of ZFS (mirror) storage servers on different locations, but I am in doubt about how to let users best upload files. ZFS handles quotas and reservation.\r\n\r\nI am running with a replicated Galera database on all servers, both for safety, but also for easy access to user accounts from each server. In other words, each server has a local copy of the database all the time. All users are virtual users **only**.\r\n\r\nSo far I have testes the following setup options:\r\n\r\n**Solution 1**\r\n\r\nRunning SFTP (ProFTPD with module) or FTPS (Pure-FTPs with TLS) on the storage servers with virtual users.\r\n\r\nThis gives people direct access to the storage servers using a client like Filezilla. At the same time users can also upload using our web GUI from our main web server.\r\n\r\nOne advantage with this setup is that the FTP server can handle virtual users. Our web application will also send files via SFTP or FTPS.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage is that FTP is meeh, annoying to firewall. Also I much prefer FTP over SSH (SFTP), rather than FTP over TLS (FTPS). However, only ProFTPD has a module for SSH, but it has been a real pain (many problems with non-working configuration options and file permission errors) to work with compared to PureFTPd, but PureFTPd only supports TLS.\r\n\r\nRunning with real SSH/SCP accounts and using PAM is **not** an option.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2**\r\n\r\nMount the storage servers locally on the web server using NFS or CIFS (Samba is great at automatic resume in case a box goes down).\r\n\r\nIn this setup users can **only** upload via our main web server. The web server application, and the application running on the storage servers, then needs to support resumable uploads. I have been looking into using the tus protocol.\r\n\r\nA disadvantage with both the above setups is that storage capacity needs to be managed somehow. When storage server 1 reaches its maximum number of users, the application needs to know this and then only create virtual users for storage server 2, 3, etc.\r\n\r\nI have calculated how many users each storage server can hold and then have the web application check the database with virtual users to see when it needs to move newly created users to the next storage server.\r\n\r\nThis is rather old school, but it works.\r\n\r\n**Solution 3**\r\n\r\nSame as solution 2 (no FTP), but clone our web application upload thingy to each storage server and then redirect users (or provide them with a physical link to the storage server, s1.example.com, s2.example.com, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe possibly advantage with this setup is that users upload directly to the storage server they have been assigned to rather than go trough our main web server (preventing it from becoming a possible bottleneck).\r\n\r\n**Solution 4**\r\n\r\nUse GlusterFS on the storage servers and build a cluster that can easily be expanded. I have tested out GlusterFS and it works very well for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe advantage with this setup is that I don&#39;t really need to care about where files physically go on which storage servers, and I can easily expand storage by adding more servers to the cluster.\r\n\r\nHowever, the disadvantage here is again that our main web server might become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nI have also considered adding a load balancer and then use multiple web server in case our main web server becomes a bottleneck for uploading files.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I much prefer to keep it simple!

The reason is subtle, but important. Let&#39;s say that your background application takes 10 seconds to execute and produces a decent amount of data. For `nohup` to work, you will need to wait for the background application to finish before you can process the data from that file. You will miss out on the befit of using a background process in the first place which is parallelism. This is true not just from `nohup` output, but for any regular file.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of not waiting for the background file to finish executing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ { for i in {0..100}; do echo $i; sleep 0.1; done } &gt; outfile &amp;\r\n[1] 2069\r\n$ grep 1 outfile\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the grep process immediately processes the file and exits before the background application is finished writing data.\r\n\r\nWhen using a named pipe, the foreground process, `grep` in this case, will know that it needs to wait for the pipe to close. Notice the difference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkfifo outpipe\r\n$ { for i in {0..100}; do echo $i; sleep 0.1; done } &gt; outpipe &amp;\r\n[1] 2173\r\n$ grep 1 outpipe\r\n1\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18\r\n19\r\n21\r\n31\r\n41\r\n51\r\n61\r\n71\r\n81\r\n91\r\n100\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a named pipe, we can use the output of the background process just as if it were coming from a pipe.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459112/how-to-grep-from-background-process/58459661#58459661","title":"How to grep from background process?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10146782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/158b8c2d05e18b6082b0f873ab311521?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sucheta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10146782/sucheta"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10146782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/158b8c2d05e18b6082b0f873ab311521?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sucheta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10146782/sucheta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571446565,"creation_date":1571439965,"last_edit_date":1571441037,"question_id":58459112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58459112","body_markdown":"I have a script, that runs an app.\r\nThe app produces some output\r\nI need to grep from the output in order to verify it\r\nHow can I accomplish this?\r\n\r\nFor instance;\r\n\r\nscript1.sh\r\n\r\n        #!/bin/sh\r\n\r\n        app1 &amp;\r\n        app2\r\n\r\n        ******\r\n        Output:\r\n        app1 -&gt;

The runs for takes several seconds, and outputs text constantly to `stdout`. Eventually, the tool will terminate on its own. My app reads its output asynchronously with `readInBackgroundAndNotify`.\r\n\r\n**If I stop processing the async output as soon as the tool has exited, I will lose some of its output.**\r\n\r\nWhich means I have to wait a little longer, allowing the RunLoop to process pending *read* notifications. **How do I know when I&#39;m done with this?**\r\n\r\nThis problem can be verified in the code below by removing the line with the `runMode:` call - then the program will print that zero lines were processed. So it appears that at the time the process has exited, there&#39;s already a notification in the queue that is waiting to be delivered, and that delivery happens thru the `runMode:` call.\r\n\r\nNow, it might appear that simply calling `runMode:` *once* after the tool&#39;s exit may be enough, but my testing shows that it isn&#39;t - sometimes (with larger amounts of output data), this will still only process parts of the remaining data.\r\n\r\n**So, what I need is a condition that I can test to make sure that all of the buffered output data has been delivered.**\r\n\r\nBelow is my test code that can be pasted into a new Xcode project&#39;s `AppDelegate.m` file. It first waits for the termination of the tool with `waitUntilExit`. If it would then immediately remove the `outputFileHandleReadCompletionObserver`, most of the tool&#39;s output would be missed. By adding the `runMode:` invocation for the duration of a second, all output from the tool is received - Of course, this timed loop is less than optimal. How do I do this properly?\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to keep the `runModal` function synchronous, i.e. it shall not return before it has received all output from the tool. It does run in its own tread in my actual program, if that matters (I saw a comment from Peter Hosey warning that `waitUntilExit` would block the UI, but that would not be an issue in my case).\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification\r\n{\r\n\t[self runTool];\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)runTool\r\n{\r\n\t// Retrieve 200 lines of text by invoking `head -n 200 /usr/share/dict/words`\r\n\tNSTask *theTask = [[NSTask alloc] init];\r\n\ttheTask.qualityOfService = NSQualityOfServiceUserInitiated;\r\n\ttheTask.launchPath = @&quot;/usr/bin/head&quot;;\r\n\ttheTask.arguments = @[@&quot;-n&quot;, @&quot;200&quot;, @&quot;/usr/share/dict/words&quot;];\r\n\t\r\n\t__block int lineCount = 0;\r\n\t\r\n\tNSPipe *outputPipe = [NSPipe pipe];\r\n\ttheTask.standardOutput = outputPipe;\r\n\tNSFileHandle *outputFileHandle = outputPipe.fileHandleForReading;\r\n\tNSString __block *prevPartialLine = @&quot;&quot;;\r\n\tid &lt;NSObject&gt; outputFileHandleReadCompletionObserver = [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NSFileHandleReadCompletionNotification object:outputFileHandle queue:nil usingBlock:^(NSNotification * _Nonnull note)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// Read the output from the cmdline tool\r\n\t\tNSData *data = [note.userInfo objectForKey:NSFileHandleNotificationDataItem];\r\n\t\tif (data.length &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\t\t// go over each line\r\n\t\t\tNSString *output = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\r\n\t\t\tNSArray *lines = [[prevPartialLine stringByAppendingString:output] componentsSeparatedByString:@&quot;\\n&quot;];\r\n\t\t\tprevPartialLine = [lines lastObject];\r\n\t\t\tNSInteger lastIdx = lines.count - 1;\r\n\t\t\t[lines enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(NSString *line, NSUInteger idx, BOOL * _Nonnull stop) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (idx == lastIdx) return;\t// skip the last (= incomplete) line as it&#39;s not terminated by a LF\r\n\t\t\t\t// now we can process `line`\r\n\t\t\t\tlineCount += 1;\r\n\t\t\t}];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t[note.object readInBackgroundAndNotify];\r\n\t}];\r\n\t\r\n\tNSParameterAssert(outputFileHandle);\r\n\t[outputFileHandle readInBackgroundAndNotify];\r\n\t\r\n\t// Start the task\r\n\t[theTask launch];\r\n\t\r\n\t// Wait until it is finished\r\n\t[theTask waitUntilExit];\r\n\t\r\n\t// Wait one more second so that we can process any remaining output from the tool\r\n\tNSDate *endDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:1];\r\n\twhile ([NSDate.date compare:endDate] == NSOrderedAscending) {\r\n\t\t[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1]];\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:outputFileHandleReadCompletionObserver];\r\n\t\r\n\tNSLog(@&quot;Lines processed: %d&quot;, lineCount);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459095/how-to-read-all-remaining-output-of-readinbackgroundandnotify-after-nstask-has-e","title":"How to read all remaining output of readInBackgroundAndNotify after NSTask has ended?"},{"tags":["php"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":545,"user_id":1507619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3361ffe35af2b9095ccdb5b4e56d61f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nuxwin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1507619/nuxwin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571440353,"post_id":58459094,"comment_id":103255005,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459094/open-a-pdf-inline-in-the-browser-file-link-has-no-extension#comment103255005_58459094"},{"owner":{"reputation":4663,"user_id":794749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pfE2l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gre_gor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/794749/gre-gor"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571440639,"post_id":58459094,"comment_id":103255060,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459094/open-a-pdf-inline-in-the-browser-file-link-has-no-extension#comment103255060_58459094"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12240968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1430536900443603/picture?type=large","display_name":"spacecabbie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240968/spacecabbie"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571440221,"creation_date":1571440221,"answer_id":58459141,"question_id":58459094,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58459141","body_markdown":"Sorry i though i did a thorough search but i din&#39;t solution is here: \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5670785/chrome-has-failed-to-load-pdf-document-error-message-on-inline-pdfs?rq=1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459094/open-a-pdf-inline-in-the-browser-file-link-has-no-extension/58459141#58459141","title":"open a pdf inline in the browser.

Instead, the created bundle\r\n&gt; relies on that dependency to be present in the consumer&#39;s environment.\r\n&gt; This feature is typically most useful to library developers, however\r\n&gt; there are a variety of applications for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you could update UI Kit webpack config to not include `react` and the peerDependencies should take care of the dependency handling for any consumers of the library.\r\n\r\n**Updated webpack.config**\r\n\r\n    const path = require(&quot;path&quot;);\r\n    module.exports = {\r\n      mode: &quot;production&quot;,\r\n      entry: &quot;./src/index.js&quot;,\r\n      output: {\r\n        path: path.resolve(&quot;dist&quot;),\r\n        filename: &quot;index.js&quot;,\r\n        libraryTarget: &quot;commonjs2&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      module: {\r\n        rules: [\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.jsx?$/,\r\n            exclude: /(node_modules)/,\r\n            use: &quot;babel-loader&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|otf)$/,\r\n            use: [\r\n              {\r\n                loader: &quot;file-loader&quot;,\r\n                options: {\r\n                  name: &quot;[name].[ext]&quot;,\r\n                  limit: 10000,\r\n                  mimetype: &quot;application/font-woff&quot;\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      resolve: {\r\n        alias: {\r\n          components: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;src/components/&quot;),\r\n          utils: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;src/utils/&quot;),\r\n          themes: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;src/themes/&quot;)\r\n        },\r\n        extensions: [&quot;.js&quot;, &quot;.jsx&quot;]\r\n      },\r\n      externals: {\r\n            // Use external version of React\r\n            react: &quot;react&quot;\r\n     },\r\n      devtool: false\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have published a test package to confirm this ([react-ui-kit-dontuse][1]).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Demo links**\r\n\r\n    v0.0.21(Without webpack externals) \r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-xyjgep\r\n\r\n\r\n    v0.0.23(With webpack externals) \r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ihnmrl\r\n\r\n\r\nSource code of test package: https://github.com/nithinthampi/react-ui-lib-test\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ui-kit-dontuse\r\n  [2]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-xyjgep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459071/importing-and-using-component-from-custom-react-component-library-results-in-inv/58492142#58492142","title":"Importing and using component from custom React Component Library results in Invariant Violation: Invalid hook call"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11512685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XcdluQv6f0U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd4gwui-9gGBdv65LUu3Uo8YhXdKA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Morgan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11512685/morgan-yu"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58492142,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571682360,"creation_date":1571439515,"question_id":58459071,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58459071","body_markdown":"My work is making a React UI Kit/Component Library to be used internally for our products.

Let&#39;s say you have a main program that has an editor and a save command. This is your main thread. Your save command is executed in a worker thread, an instance of QThread that can run next to your main thread. When the user clicks save, your worker thread will send a Qt Signal saying that the save command was executed. Your main thread can then refresh the file contents. Now because you use QThread and Qt Signals you will not need any mutex or semaphore or any kind of resource locking because that&#39;s already done for you.

Doesn&#39;t have to be online, main purpose is to handle concurrent file editing. I just don&#39;t know how to approach this task.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done till now is to build a simple text editor. Program has two text areas. In text area 1 you write your code. In text area 2 it shows the output. When you run your code it saves the contents of the text area 1 to a file (Code.cpp for example) then compile the saved file. When it compiled, another function runs the exe and writes the output to another file(This done in powershell&#39;s Out-File command). text area 2 just reads the content of the output file.\r\n\r\nFor single user this works. The problem is I don&#39;t know how to handle when there are multiple users. Someone suggested me that I should use text editor program as a client and handle concurrent operations in a server. That seems like a nice approach. Does that mean I should also handle the save file and run code option on the server?\r\n\r\nAnd how do I do let multiple users edit the same file? Obviously I&#39;m not asking for a -real- code. I know mutexes and semaphores but never implemented one. Some pseudo code might help maybe? I don&#39;t know where to start to dig up so here I am.

bar()\r\nfoo()\r\n```\r\ngives:\r\n```\r\n{&#39;y&#39;: 1}\r\n1\r\n```\r\nbecause inside bar(), we have one local variable &#39;y&#39;.\r\n\r\nBut the local variable &#39;y&#39; just disappears when I change it to:\r\n```\r\ndef foo():\r\n    def bar():\r\n        print(locals())\r\n        y = y + 1\r\n        print(y)\r\n    y = 1\r\n    bar()\r\nfoo()\r\n```\r\nprint(locals()) outputs {}, I

This back-end has no need for Angular besides this HttpClient dependency.  But, I need to keep this shared API library back-ward compatible for the Angular UI.  \r\n\r\nI have two choices, and am asking for help and advice on either:\r\n\r\n1. Keep using Angular&#39;s [HttpClient][1], but find a way to make it work w/o injection.  I know you can bootstrap it to do the injection, but then I have no idea how to access those service class instances from outside it.  The benefit to this option is no impact to the Angular UI project consuming the API services.  \r\n\r\n2.  Use another http client that supports Typescript.  Note the biggest caveat here besides the obvious rewrite of the API services, is if it does not support RXJS Observerables, then it can impact a lot of the current application code consuming the API in the current Angular UI.  That said, any recommendations on a good substitute?  \r\n\r\nI like the features of &#39;[request][2]&#39;, and there are [types][3] for it, but I can&#39;t find any documentation on how to use the types.

The previously working code had no issues.  Since, then, I&#39;ve added parameters (looking up values on an open form) to the crosstab, but no other changes.  There are no errors, but the code returns field count = 0.  ??  It was working flawlessly beforehand.  Again, the only change I made is to replace a hard-coded date in the crosstab with a form reference, and added the parameter so the crosstab can be dynamic.  The query opens fine with no errors, so I&#39;m stumped why this change would make a difference. \r\n\r\nOne other thing I have noted is that the c in &quot;.Count&quot; at the end of the line of code updates to a lower case c (.count) after I advance to the next line.  I would expect this to remain a capital letter.  This is a work computer, and it went through a lot of software updates yesterday.

You could use that to take an input image, then bake-in text to the output image.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you&#39;re looking to create something more like a full-featured video editor (Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Avid, etc.), the answer is that it will be very, very hard. An honest-to-goodness NLE probably requires an engineering staff of tens (if not hundreds) of people who work for years. Creating a simple utility to superimpose text on images for an internal website would take a single engineer a few days to few weeks. Depending on your specific goals, the difficulty could be anywhere between these two extremes.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of advice: whoever is your software engineer for this task, strive for dialogue on the difficulty of different approaches/objectives. Some things will be trivially easy to code, while others will be crushingly hard. From the outside though, it can be hard to tell the difference between what objectives will be which of the two extremes.

You can construct it using the [json functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), specifically the [aggregate function `json_object_agg`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html):\r\n\r\n    SELECT chip_id, json_object_agg(some_val, record)\r\n    FROM test_records\r\n    GROUP BY chip_id\r\n\r\n&lt;!--&gt;\r\n\r\n    1\t{ &quot;thumbnail&quot; : 53, &quot;first_failure&quot; : 42, &quot;another_metric&quot; : 33 }\r\n    2\t{ &quot;thumbnail&quot; : 54 }\r\n\r\nNow to get the chip id, or even better its name, in that object I can think of two approaches. The first one would use `jsonb_set` to create a new key in the aggregated object:\r\n\r\n    select jsonb_set(jsonb_object_agg(some_val, record), &#39;{chip_name}&#39;::text[], to_jsonb(name))\r\n    FROM chips \r\n    INNER JOIN test_records ON test_records.chip_id = chips.id\r\n    GROUP BY id\r\n\r\nThe second would be to select the aggregate from a union:\r\n\r\n    SELECT json_object_agg(key, value)\r\n    FROM (TABLE test_records\r\n      UNION ALL\r\n      SELECT id, &#39;chip_id&#39;, id\r\n      FROM chips) as kv(id, key, value)\r\n    GROUP BY id\r\n\r\n([online demo of all queries](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_12&amp;fiddle=b325eee51ee6f0a583957c295d51d237))\r\n\r\nOf course you can also use a `WHERE` clause to filter for a single result instead of using the `GROUP BY id` demonstrated above. You might even be able to hardcode the value of the `chip_id` key:\r\n\r\n    SELECT json_object_agg(key, value)\r\n    FROM (SELECT some_val as key, record as value\r\n      FROM test_records\r\n      WHERE chip_id = 1\r\n      UNION ALL\r\n      VALUES (&#39;chip_id&#39;, 1)\r\n    ) kv\r\n\r\n([online demo of all approaches](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_12&amp;fiddle=6b4e606ce770a786acc13c1fcb559d17))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58459007/how-to-roll-multiple-rows-into-one-summary-row/58459676#58459676","title":"How to roll multiple rows into one summary row?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1180,"user_id":1123905,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6759dcef8e5aad4e77509e5479b9823?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BigBoy1337","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1123905/bigboy1337"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571446768,"creation_date":1571438881,"question_id":58459007,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58459007","body_markdown":"I have the following schema and data: \r\n\r\n    create table chips (\r\n      ID serial PRIMARY KEY,\r\n      name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL\r\n      );\r\n      \r\n    create table test_records (\r\n      chip_id INTEGER,\r\n      some_val VARCHAR (255),\r\n      record INTEGER\r\n      );\r\n      \r\n    insert into chips values \r\n    (1,&#39;chip_1&#39;),\r\n    (2,&#39;chip_2&#39;);\r\n    insert into test_records values\r\n    (1,&#39;thumbnail&#39;,53),\r\n    (1,&#39;first_failure&#39;,42),\r\n    (1,&#39;another_metric&#39;,33),\r\n    (2,&#39;thumbnail&#39;,54)\r\n\r\nThen I try and run the following sql: \r\n\r\n    select * \r\n    FROM \r\n    chips \r\n    INNER JOIN test_records ON test_records.chip_id = chips.id\r\n    WHERE \r\n    chips.id = 1\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works. I have a fiddle here: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/qMmJ6UxMfx8Fd87wgAsaBs/0\r\n\r\nBut what I want to do is something like \r\n\r\n    select\r\n    chip.id\r\n    test_record.thumbnail\r\n    test_record.first_failure\r\n    FROM \r\n    test_records\r\n    INNER JOIN chips ON chips.id = test_record.chips\r\n    WHERE \r\n    chips.id = 1\r\n\r\nand have a single row that looks like \r\n\r\n    (chip_id:1, thumbnail:53,first_failure:42)\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work of course because thumbnail and first_failure are not columns. \r\nI basically want it to, where chip_id is 1 with those joins, look for the values in some_val where the value is thumbnail or first failure and attribute the record as that in the result. \r\n\r\nI know this is kind of open ended. I don&#39;t even know where to start. Is this something where I need a pivot table? I don&#39;t know much about those but that it creates a temporary table during the query. Or do I need a subquery? Where I select (query for thumbnail record) AS thumbnail, (query for first_failure AS first failure). OR is it much easier and Im overcomplicating things..\r\n\r\nAlso any title improvements would be welcome.

To this end I have tried to format the `x-amazon-apigateway-integration` section of the openapi json document for this endpoint as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;x-amazon-apigateway-integration&quot;: {\r\n    ...\r\n    &quot;responses&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;.*statusCode\\\\\\&quot;:400.*&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;statusCode&quot;: &quot;400&quot;,\r\n            &quot;responseTemplates&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;application/json&quot;: &quot;#set ($errorMessageObj = $util.parseJson($input.path(&#39;$.errorMessage&#39;))) \\n{ \\&quot;message\\&quot; : \\&quot;$errorMessageObj.message\\&quot;}&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe raw output from my lambda (i.e. before transformations) looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;{\\&quot;statusCode\\&quot;:400,\\&quot;message\\&quot;:\\&quot;Invalid request parameters\\&quot;}&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation would be that the final response would have an error code of `400` and the object returned to my client would be \r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Invalid request parameters&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am getting the full untransformed response object back with a response code of 200 (the default).

But given the signature of `TakesImplementor()`, it could be implemented like this:\r\n\r\n    function TakesImplementor(e: Implements): void {\r\n        console.log(e.s.toUpperCase());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s fine, right?  `TakesImplementor()` accepts a parameter named `e` of type `Implements`, which has an `s` property of type `string`.  Inside `TakesImplementor()` you can access `e.s.toUpperCase()`.\r\n\r\nAnd then, given the signature of `f()`, it could be implemented like this:\r\n\r\n    function f(t: TakesEmpty) {\r\n        t({});\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s also fine, right?  The `t` parameter passed into `f()` is itself a function of the type `TakesEmpty`, meaning you should be able to call `t({})`, since the object `{}` is a valid `Empty`.\r\n\r\nYep, everything great until you go ahead and run this:\r\n\r\n    f(TakesImplementor);\r\n\r\nAnd it explodes at runtime.  `f(TakesImplementor)` calls `TakesImplementor({})`, which calls `{}.s.toUpperCase()`, which doesn&#39;t exist because `{}.s` is undefined.  Boom. *That* is why the line `f(TakesImplementor)` gives an error message:\r\n\r\n    // Property &#39;s&#39; is missing in type &#39;Empty&#39; but required in type &#39;Implements&#39;.\r\n\r\n`TakesImplementor` is not a `TakesEmpty`, because `TakesImplementor` only accepts `Implements` types, while `TakesEmpty` is required to accept all `Empty` types, not just `Implements` types.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIt might be counterintuitive, but when dealing with functions, you *narrow* its type when you *widen* the type of its parameters, and you *widen* its type when you *narrow* the type of its parameters.  This &quot;going-the-other-way&quot; of function parameters is known as [*contravariance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)#Function_types).  They vary in the opposite way, or &quot;contra-vary&quot;. (This is as opposed to function *return* types, which widen the function type when widened and narrow the function type when narrowed... they vary together, or &quot;co-vary&quot;, and thus are *covariant*.) \r\n\r\nBy narrowing the parameter type of `TakesImplementor` from `Empty` to `Implements`, you have *widened* the type of `TakesImplementor` itself compared to `TakesEmpty`.  Every `TakesEmpty` can be used in place of `TakesImplementor`, but not vice versa.  Contravariant.\r\n\r\nContravariance of function parameter types is enforced in TypeScript 2.6 and above when you use the [`--strictFunctionTypes` compiler flag](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-6.html#strict-function-types) (also enabled with just `--strict`).  It&#39;s generally a good thing to enforce.\r\n\r\nHope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=9&amp;ssc=1&amp;pln=18&amp;pc=1#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgKIFsAOYCeyDeyAvgFAkIA2cAztcgJJYUToTh3BMtth0bZ58JZCOQIA9iGpgoAVwRhxUABSZZAIwrAEyagC5dM0AHMAlAWIlSJXJhQAVOAGsI1frmQBeZMogH3OOaeAHzIAG7iwAAmANxkMLIgCsCSyI4u1IyYzKzgSr4GWTk81KYGEdEEwqISUuLMAHQU4sa+DdQNigCqmHZQAMI0EMqmpnGkCUlgKSDIMMpgBumuAeZCoshgyvhEY1Yk88uZXLmKUHtkQA)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458982/why-cant-a-parameter-of-function-type-take-an-argument-whose-parameters-impleme/58459554#58459554","title":"Why can&#39;t a parameter of function type take an argument whose parameters implement the original parameter&#39;s interface?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10140394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v3nXwYi-TQA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABY4/Iz9CdYBBYzE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon Cohen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10140394/jon-cohen"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58459554,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571444979,"creation_date":1571438576,"question_id":58458982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458982","body_markdown":"Okay so the title is weird.

First of all, I&#39;ll reformat it:\r\n```\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length: Int, components: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; =\r\n    if (components.isEmpty() || length &lt;= 0) listOf(listOf())\r\n    else components.map { elm -&gt;\r\n        nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).map { sub -&gt; listOf(elm) + sub }\r\n    }.fold(listOf(listOf())) { result, elm -&gt; result + elm }\r\n```\r\nThe first problem is `elm -&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components)`. Here you call `nonexhaustivePermutations` with the same arguments for each `elm` on each recursion step. So I suggest swapping `components.map` with `nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).map`:\r\n```\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length: Int, components: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; =\r\n    if (components.isEmpty() || length &lt;= 0) listOf(listOf())\r\n    else nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).map { sub -&gt;\r\n        components.map { elm -&gt; listOf(elm) + sub }\r\n    }.fold(listOf(listOf())) { result, elm -&gt; result + elm }\r\n```\r\nBut in addition to significantly improving performance, this swapping also reorders the returned elements. It can partly be fixed by replacing `listOf(elm) + sub` with `sub + elm`:\r\n```\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length: Int, components: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; =\r\n    if (components.isEmpty() || length &lt;= 0) listOf(listOf())\r\n    else nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).map { sub -&gt;\r\n        components.map { elm -&gt; sub + elm }\r\n    }.fold(listOf(listOf())) { result, elm -&gt; result + elm }\r\n```\r\nIf you run this method, you will see that it returns permutations in order of length increasing. So short permutations are added first. To be more precise, they are added at the time the list is created. So to get rid of them, `fold(listOf(listOf()))` must be replaced with `fold(emptyList())`:\r\n```\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length: Int, components: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; =\r\n    if (components.isEmpty() || length &lt;= 0) listOf(listOf())\r\n    else nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).map { sub -&gt;\r\n        components.map { elm -&gt; sub + elm }\r\n    }.fold(emptyList()) { result, elm -&gt; result + elm }\r\n```\r\nThis version works properly. But the only thing the last line does is list flatting. And flatting can be combined with mapping by replacing `map` with `flatMap`:\r\n```\r\nfun &lt;T&gt; nonexhaustivePermutations(length: Int, components: List&lt;T&gt;): List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; =\r\n    if (components.isEmpty() || length &lt;= 0) listOf(listOf())\r\n    else nonexhaustivePermutations(length - 1, components).flatMap { sub -&gt;\r\n        components.map { elm -&gt; sub + elm } \r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458981/how-can-one-generate-non-exhaustive-permutations-of-a-certain-length-in-a-functi/58463180#58463180","title":"How can one generate non-exhaustive permutations of a certain length in a functional style"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12240875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1820488537981506/picture?type=large","display_name":"Emil Jansson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240875/emil-jansson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58463180,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571490509,"creation_date":1571438576,"question_id":58458981,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458981","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a function that generates all possible permutations of length n, where the objects being listed are taken non-exhaustively from a set S.
