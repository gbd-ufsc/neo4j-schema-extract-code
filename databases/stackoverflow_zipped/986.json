Rewrite your app to use different mechanism of connecting to SF.\r\n\r\nLong answer: Standard Salesforce API (SOAP or REST, doesn&#39;t matter) is synchronous. Request-response, job done. It&#39;s limited to 200 records max in one API call. Your volumes are better suited for bulk API. That one is REST-only (although it can accept XML, JSON or CSV), up to 10K records in one API call. The key difference is that it&#39;s asynchronous. You submit the job, you get back the job&#39;s id, you can check it (every 10 seconds? every minute?) &quot;is it done yet? if it is - give me back my success/failure results&quot;. But every of these checks will of course consume 1 API call too. In meantime SF received a bunch of zipped files from you and will work on unzipping and processing them as fast as resources allow.\r\n\r\nSo (ignoring the initial `login` call) let&#39;s talk about limits. In sandboxes the 24h rolling limit of API calls is 5 million calls. Massive. In production it&#39;s 15K API calls + 1K per every full license user you have (sales cloud, service cloud) + you can buy more capacity... Or just go to Setup -&gt; Company Information and check your limit.\r\n\r\nlet&#39;s say you have 5 users so 20K calls/day in production. In 24h at max capacity you&#39;ll be able to push 10K * 20K = 200M inserts/updates. Well, bit less because of login calls and checking the status and pulling down the results file but still - pretty good. If that&#39;s not enough - you have bigger problems ;) Using standard API would let you go 200 * 20K = mere 4M records.\r\n\r\nSF support told you to use Data Loader because in DL it&#39;s just ticking a checkbox to use bulk API. You don&#39;t care that backend mechanism is different. You could even script Data Loader to run from commandline (https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/216/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/salesforce_data_loader.pdf chapter 4). Or if it&#39;s a Java application - just reuse the JAR file on top of which DL UI is built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese might help too:\r\n\r\n - https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/large-data-volumes/load-your-data\r\n - https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_bulk\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58308006/big-data-load-in-salesforce/58313270#58313270","title":"big data load in salesforce"}],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":10238261,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zoOjfcwJ7U4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADCc/X7ZxK24Wyi4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rakesh Prasad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10238261/rakesh-prasad"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570661455,"creation_date":1570636599,"question_id":58308006,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58308006","body_markdown":"I came across weird constraint, want to hear if anyone has resolved this issue.\r\n\r\nProblem statement: load data in salesforce from outside. volume of data is 1 million record in a burst, every 3 hrs.\r\n\r\nmy source orchestration tool (NiFi) is capable of making this many REST API, but salesforce has asked not to use REST with this much throughput.

For example,\r\n\r\n``` lang-java\r\n    String response = restTemplate.&lt;your-uri&gt;\r\n    JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(response);\r\n    if (jsonObject.get(type).equals(type1) {\r\n        Type1 type1 = new Type1();\r\n        // set values\r\n    } else if (jsonObject.get(type).equals(type2) {\r\n        Type2 type2 = new Type2()\r\n        // set values\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nHowever, this is not scalable and if you are going add more and more types it would be very difficult to maintain a clean code.\r\n\r\nAnother way you can do this is to create a General Class and receive the response as List of that class. In this way Spring-boot/ jackson cand do the mapping. Again you have to add code to create the other classes from this general class. As Sam pointed out in the comment, this would be a preferred one since Jackson is faster than JSONObject. Here is sample class would look like,\r\n```java\r\nclass Response {\r\n    private Integer id;\r\n    private String type;\r\n    private Map&lt;String, Object&gt; config;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou still have to check the type and map to corresponding class. \r\n\r\nInstead of writing such messy code, I would consider if I could re-architect your design/ response sent if you have control over it. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307993/custom-mapping-from-json-to-java-pojo-in-spring-resttemplate-response/58309075#58309075","title":"Custom Mapping from JSON to Java/POJO in Spring RestTemplate response"}],"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":5941365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c06b74ee613569292952eef5a559e4f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"adesai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5941365/adesai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1176,"user_id":7538821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FaRRO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7538821/sam"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570724198,"creation_date":1570636549,"last_edit_date":1570651408,"question_id":58307993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307993","body_markdown":"I have a Spring boot application where I am using RestTemplate to call a Rest API and I receive following JSON formatted response:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;data&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;type1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;config&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;property1&quot;

We would like to use FFmpeg as a important part of an AR project.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we find it is not easy for us.\r\n\r\nWe want to compose the footages with FFmpeg.\r\n\r\nWe got 5 layers, wanted to blend them with specific mode, like the things in After Effects.\r\n\r\n- layer-1/ [A.webm] video，vp9 codec, which has a transparent BG,has to be added as [normal mode]\r\n\r\n- layer-2/ [B.mp4] video, optical-flare things with black BG,has to be added as [screen mode]\r\n\r\n- layer-3/ [C.mp4] video, some motion graphic things with light BG,has to be added as [overlay mode]\r\n\r\n- layer-4/ [BG.MP4], backgound things, has to be added as [normal mode]\r\n\r\nAfter we blend those 4 (like pre-compose,use blend filter), we want to add another layer-5/[icon.png] which is the special icon. \r\n\r\nLayer-5 need to overlay the pre-compose. We have to overlay it at the special position (use overlay filter?).\r\n\r\nCause [icon.png] may change frequently. we want to deal with that after the 4 layer blending.\r\n\r\nBut at the first step, when we set normal mode for layer-1 in blend filter, layer-1 [A.webm] lost the transparent BG，it gave us a black BG which block all other things.\r\nBlend filter can not handle the alpha channel of vp9 webm?\r\nWhen we set the mode of layer-1 to screen mode,the translucent thing was not what we need.\r\n\r\nCould you please give us some commands to achieve the blend above?\r\n\r\nThe commands that really work will be extremely useful for our FFmpeg initiation.\r\n\r\n    ffmpeg -c:v libvpx-vp9 -i transparent.webm -i bg.mp4 -filter_complex &quot;[0:v]format=yuva420p [a]; [1:v]format=yuv420p

The end product in my Qlik sheet should have a table that displays a &quot;% Covered&quot; column. What this is is the percentage of items in a department that the inventory is greater or equal than the requirement.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what the end table should look like (The Percent Covered field is a calculated field:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| Department | Count of Products | Percent Covered |\r\n|------------|-------------------|-----------------|\r\n| Bio        | 34858             | 89.40%          |\r\n| Mech       | 50119             | 92.05%          |\r\n| Admin      | 560               | 98.22%          |\r\n```\r\nTo hopefully illustrate this better, this is what it would look like if you were to apply the calculation to a table of product numbers:\r\n```\r\n| Product Number | Inventory | Requirement | Percent Covered |\r\n|----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|\r\n| 444391         | 112       | 113         | 99.11%          |\r\n| 444569         | 86        | 350         | 24.57%          |\r\n| 443551         | 12        | 11          | 109.09%         |\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\nThough it *works in testing with small amounts of data*, when loaded with the real data it is too much for Qlik to handle in the expressions on the charts themselves and throws timeout errors:\r\n\r\n`Count({&lt;ProductNumber = {&quot;=[Inventory] &gt;= [Requirement]&quot;}&gt;} ProductNumber) / Count(ProductNumber)`\r\n\r\nTo get around this, I&#39;ve been trying to do the above work in the data load script. With the help of the Qlik docs and Community Forum, this is apparently something should work:\r\nIn the data loader script: `If([Inventory] &gt;= [Requirement], 1, 0) as Flag`\r\nIn the expression: `Count({&lt;Flag = {&#39;1&#39;}&gt;} ProductNumber)/Count(ProductNumber)`\r\n\r\nThe problem is, **no matter where I place this in the script, it throws errors.**\r\n\r\n# What I&#39;ve Tried\r\nI&#39;ve tried all these combos with and without semicolons.\r\n```\r\n[MyAwesomeSheet]:\r\nIf([Inventory] &gt;= [Requirement], 1, 0) as Flag\r\nLOAD\r\n    [ProductNumber],\r\n\t[Requirement],\r\n\t[Inventory],\r\n\t[Department],\r\n FROM [lib://Desktop/fake-example-data.xlsx]\r\n(ooxml, embedded labels, table is [MyAwesomeTable]);\r\n```\r\n&gt; Error: &quot;Data has not been loaded.

So why do I receive a &quot;Summary of failures for Google Apps Script&quot; email containing the following error?\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot find function getRespondentEmail in object [object Object]...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it a glitch that will go away or have I missed something?\r\n\r\nThanks \t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307986/getrespondentemail-generates-a-script-failure-even-though-it-returns-the-respo","title":"getRespondentEmail() generates a script failure even though it returns the respondents email address"},{"tags":["css","reactjs","typescript","react-router","react-router-dom"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12152982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a96f15c74d4368c8399d71a09d8834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anon_dcs3spp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152982/anon-dcs3spp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570695889,"post_id":58310647,"comment_id":102996581,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307983/how-to-render-activeclassname-style-for-a-react-router-dom-navlink-rendered-with/58310647#comment102996581_58310647"},{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12152982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a96f15c74d4368c8399d71a09d8834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anon_dcs3spp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152982/anon-dcs3spp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570698618,"post_id":58310647,"comment_id":102997998,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307983/how-to-render-activeclassname-style-for-a-react-router-dom-navlink-rendered-with/58310647#comment102997998_58310647"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":319,"user_id":9565135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d993baadf7511f092ac7f677dbc2926?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bgaynor78","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9565135/bgaynor78"},"last_editor":{"reputation":319,"user_id":9565135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d993baadf7511f092ac7f677dbc2926?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bgaynor78","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9565135/bgaynor78"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570648183,"last_edit_date":1570648183,"creation_date":1570647811,"answer_id":58310647,"question_id":58307983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58310647","body_markdown":"What you have should work, but you are passing a class name, not a style, so I think you just need to make your `activeClassName` prop equal to &quot;highlighted&quot;.\r\n\r\n```lang javascript\r\n&lt;Button\r\n  color=&quot;inherit&quot;\r\n  component={NavLink}\r\n  activeClassName=&quot;highlighted&quot;\r\n  to=&quot;/about&quot;\r\n &gt;\r\n  About\r\n&lt;/Button&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll also need to add `!important` to you style so it overrides the CSS of the Material UI button.\r\n\r\nWorking codesandbox [link](https://codesandbox.io/s/withered-pond-vr132)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307983/how-to-render-activeclassname-style-for-a-react-router-dom-navlink-rendered-with/58310647#58310647","title":"How to render activeClassName style for a react-router-dom NavLink rendered within a material-ui button in a typescript environment?"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12152982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a96f15c74d4368c8399d71a09d8834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anon_dcs3spp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152982/anon-dcs3spp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12152982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a96f15c74d4368c8399d71a09d8834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"anon_dcs3spp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152982/anon-dcs3spp"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58310647,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570698005,"creation_date":1570636499,"last_edit_date":1570698005,"question_id":58307983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307983","body_markdown":"I am learning react and trying to set the style of a **react-router-dom** _NavLink_ encapsulated inside a **material-ui** _Button_. I am using React with Typescript and a custom Webpack build.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink) states that this can be achieved by setting the _activeClassName_ property. \r\n\r\nIn the code listing below I try setting the _activeClassName_ on the button containing the _NavLink_ component. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    \r\nimport * as navbar from &#39;./NavBar.css&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst NavBarLinks = () =&gt; (\r\n  &lt;&gt;\r\n    &lt;Button\r\n      color=&quot;inherit&quot;\r\n      component={NavLink}\r\n      activeClassName={navbar.highlighted}\r\n      to=&quot;/about&quot;\r\n    &gt;\r\n      About\r\n    &lt;/Button&gt;\r\n  &lt;/&gt;\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe highlighted css class is as follows:\r\n```css\r\n.highlighted {\r\n  border-bottom: 3px solid rgb(174, 185, 28);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, no bottom border is rendered. How do I get the _activeClassName_ style to render for a **react-router-dom** _NavLink_ rendered within a **material-ui** _Button_ within a Typescript environment? \r\n\r\nMy build environment is configured as follows.\r\n\r\nI have created a type declaration file for the stylesheet\r\nand saved this in a folder referenced in _tsconfig.json_. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const active: string;\r\nexport const horizmenu: string;\r\nexport const highlighted: string;\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy _tsconfig.json_ includes the _typesRoot_ configuration. This references the types folder where my css type declaration file is stored:\r\n``` json\r\n&quot;typeRoots&quot;: [&quot;node_modules/@types&quot;, &quot;src/types&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy webpack development configuration is using _css-loader_ to bundle css files under _src/app/*/_\r\n``` javascript\r\n {\r\n        // link css modules\r\n        test: /\\.css$/,\r\n        include: path.resolve(constants.dir.SRC, &#39;app&#39;),\r\n        use: [\r\n          { loader: require.resolve(&#39;style-loader&#39;) },\r\n          {\r\n            loader: require.resolve(&#39;css-loader&#39;),\r\n            options: {\r\n              modules: {\r\n                localIdentName: &#39;[path][name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]&#39;,\r\n              },\r\n              importLoaders: 1,\r\n              sourceMap: true,\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        ],\r\n      },\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nWhen I perform a Webpack development build I can see that the _NavBar.css_ contents are picked up by the _css-loader_ and embedded as a string in the bundle file.

I am using this to merge the two together, and I am aware instead of red it will be a pink kind of colour and a grey instead of white since I am just blending them together with alpha.\r\n\r\n\r\n    // Start an image context\r\n    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(grabcutResult.size)\r\n            \r\n    // Create rect for this draw session\r\n    let rect = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width:

operation quickly but the only solutions I have found are either for ImageView (which only affects how stuff is rendered not the underlying UIImage) or they involve looping over the entire image pixel by pixel.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find a solution that will just mask all the white pixels in the outline to red without having to loop over the entire image pixel by pixel as it is too slow.\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be good if I could get openCV to just return a red outline instead of white but I don&#39;t think its possible to change this (maybe im wrong).\r\n\r\nUsing swift btw...

declare @permission_id as VARCHAR(7);\r\n    declare @counter as int;\r\n    declare @query as VARCHAR(MAX);\r\n    declare @name as VARCHAR(15);\r\n    \r\n    set @permission_id =

  select a.name,\r\n           max(case when seqnum = 1 then a.permission end) as permission_1,\r\n           max(case when seqnum = 2 then a.permission end) as permission_2,\r\n           max(case

  ) a\r\n    group by a.name;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is working fine for up to 120 Permissions, because that is the point where the query exceeds the max length of varchar.\r\n\r\nI have not found a solution for dynamic pivot-ing without concating a query yet, and neither I did find a solution for a longer query.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why I am asking this question. \r\n\r\nIs there a way for dynamic

The general idea is to have something that will convert arguments to methods syntax:\r\n```\r\nscraper(driver, method, arguments) == driver$method(arguments)\r\n```\r\nSo if I call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscraper(remDr, &quot;open&quot;) - it simply does - remDr$open()\r\nscraper(remDr, &quot;navigate&quot;, &quot;https://google.com&quot;) - it does - remDr$navigate(&quot;https://google.com&quot;)\r\nscraper(remDr, &quot;findElement&quot;, list(using = &quot;xpath&quot;, &quot;[@=...]&quot;) - it does - remDr$findElement(&quot;xpath&quot;, &quot;[@=...]&quot;)\r\n```\r\nHere is the sample that I&#39;ve ended up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscraper &lt;- function(driver, method, arguments = &quot;&quot;) {\r\n  \r\n  open &lt;- function(driver) {\r\n    return(\r\n        driver$open()\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  close &lt;- function(driver) {\r\n    return(\r\n        driver$close()\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  navigate &lt;- function(driver, arguments) {\r\n    return(\r\n        driver$navigate(arguments)\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  findElement &lt;- function(driver, arguments) {\r\n    return(\r\n        driver$findElement(arguments)\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  scraperMethods &lt;- list(open = open, \r\n                         close = close, \r\n                         navigate = navigate, \r\n                         findElement = findElement)\r\n  \r\n  return(scraperMethods[[method]](arguments))\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe double brackets convention in scraperMethods[[method]] seems to work in global environment but when i call\r\n```\r\nscraper(remDr, &quot;open&quot;)\r\n```\r\nor other methods defined so far within the scraper function. It throws an error:\r\n&gt;Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n1. Is this the right approach?\r\n2.

This structure is used with a DirectoryRef element to put some files there that are accessed within a custom action on InstallFinalize. Now I generated a Patch (version 1.2) that adds some files in the Temp folder. But I want that folder to be in the TARGETDIR now. So I changed \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Directory Id=&quot;LocalAppDataFolder&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;Directory Id=&quot;APPDATA_TEMP&quot; Name=&quot;Temp&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n&lt;Directory Id=&quot;MY_TEMP_PATH&quot; Name=&quot;.&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;Directory Id=&quot;APPDATA_TEMP&quot; Name=&quot;Temp&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/Directory&gt;\r\n```\r\nunderneath the \r\n```\r\n&lt;Directory Id=&quot;TARGETDIR&quot; Name=&quot;SourceDir&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\nstructure. For the Patch to be applied correctly I opened the .msi file that&#39;s referenced in the registry (under **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\UserData\\\\...\\Products\\{GUID}\\InstallProperties\\LocalPackage**) with the Orca tool and edited the corresponding values in the Directory table. I also edited the CustomActions table to reference the new path as it is used as a parameter there. So, now when I install the Patch it puts all the files (changed and new ones) in the LocalAppDataFolder as it did with the initial install. The custom action is called with the correct parameter though.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change the &quot;base&quot; msi to target my new Temp folder or, alternatively, somehow tell the Patch to use the new folder regardless of the initial path?\r\n\r\nThe goal is to apply the patch without having to uninstall the application first.\r\n\r\nAny help on how to achieve that is greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307920/wix-change-msi-directory-and-customaction-table-with-changes-to-be-used-by-ms","title":"WiX: Change .msi Directory and CustomAction table with changes to be used by .msp Patch file"},{"tags":["javascript","d3.js"],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":6682180,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64a0b8f85eeb18f6e8f54cfcaa0b3133?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jan Kowalski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6682180/jan-kowalski"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570636246,"creation_date":1570636246,"question_id":58307916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307916","body_markdown":"&lt;br&gt;\r\nI have the issues with too long descriptions that are larger than my placeholder so in order to fit it, I decided to shorten texts to fit nicely within placeholder and add ellipsis (...) at its end.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve it I just replaced existing label with that short text. But I also want to have the behaviour for displaying tooltip with full name. In order to add onmouseover event to ellipsis only, I just add a tspan element to existing label with its own class name and so on. And add event to this newly added tspan. The problem is that i need to have placeholder being keep on the top, so it can receive mouse events (this is kind of tree view, and placeholder recieves click events to collapse etc)\r\n\r\nSo I opted to bring to top only this tspan, but obviously is not working. Is there any way to append this ellipsis next to existing label as an separate text element? Briniging whole label to top works flawlessy and I can see that mouseover event is correctly added to tspan only. But in that way I cover most of the area of placeholder.\r\nHere&#39;s some code:\r\n```javascript\r\n const labelWidth = d3.select(`#label${d.data.id}`).node().textLength.baseVal.value;\r\n                   const overflowValue = containerBBox.width - drawOptions.itemWidth\r\n                   const pixelsPerChar = labelWidth / itemName.length;\r\n                   const maxAllowedCharacters = Math.floor((labelWidth - overflowValue) / pixelsPerChar);\r\n                   label.text(() =&gt; {\r\n                            return itemName.substring(0, maxAllowedCharacters - 8)});\r\n                   label.append(&#39;tspan&#39;)\r\n                   .text(&#39;(...)&#39;)\r\n                   .attr(&#39;id&#39;, `ellipsis${d.data.id}`)\r\n                   .attr(&#39;class&#39;, &#39;treeItemEllipsis&#39;)\r\n                   .attr(&#39;z-index&#39;, &#39;-1&#39;)\r\n                   .attr(&#39;position&#39;, &#39;relative&#39;)\r\n                   .on(&#39;mouseover&#39;, () =&gt; { tip.show(itemName)})\r\n                   .on(&#39;mouseout&#39;,() =&gt; {tip.hide()})\r\n```\r\nI could add some group or something above this label but this seemes to me as crazy hack. Maybe there is a simple way to do so.

Initiate authorization flow in a popup and pass back the token received by server via `postMessage()` API provided in the browser, from the popup window back to the webapp.\r\n2.

Overriding would require `virtual` member functions, and you can verify that a method actually overrides a base class function by adding the `override` keyword. Neither class is polymorphic, because there are no virtual methods anywhere.\r\n\r\n2. Since your classes are not polymorphic, you will only ever have static binding, no dynamic binding. (You correctly identified this happening).\r\n\r\n3. To call a base class function that was overridden or hidden in a derived class, you prefix the call with the base class name and `::`, like so:\r\n\r\n        class Child : public Parent{\r\n          int b;\r\n          public:\r\n            void display(){\r\n              Parent::display();\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        // or\r\n\r\n        int main()\r\n        {\r\n          Child c;\r\n          c.Parent::display();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n4. There is no difference between `Parent *p = new Child();` and `Parent *p = new Child;` in your code, both call the default constructor to initialize a new child object. For types like `int` there is a difference, `new int;` creates an uninitialized `int` object, `new int();` (or `new int{};`) initializes it to zero instead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308045#58308045","title":"How to call the overriden function of parent class in C++?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12003811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP-vQrQ2_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rftz6VngIJkF6XSocqGDvoqcLV39Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zZzZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003811/zzzz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570637868,"post_id":58308095,"comment_id":102978306,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308095#comment102978306_58308095"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12003811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP-vQrQ2_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rftz6VngIJkF6XSocqGDvoqcLV39Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zZzZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003811/zzzz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570637933,"post_id":58308095,"comment_id":102978329,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308095#comment102978329_58308095"},{"owner":{"reputation":110679,"user_id":2079303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf7f63e49a75376e0f761c8abeb6d5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eerorika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2079303/eerorika"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12003811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP-vQrQ2_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rftz6VngIJkF6XSocqGDvoqcLV39Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zZzZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003811/zzzz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570638001,"post_id":58308095,"comment_id":102978352,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308095#comment102978352_58308095"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12003811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP-vQrQ2_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rftz6VngIJkF6XSocqGDvoqcLV39Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zZzZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003811/zzzz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570639176,"post_id":58308095,"comment_id":102978872,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308095#comment102978872_58308095"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":110679,"user_id":2079303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf7f63e49a75376e0f761c8abeb6d5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eerorika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2079303/eerorika"},"last_editor":{"reputation":110679,"user_id":2079303,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf7f63e49a75376e0f761c8abeb6d5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eerorika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2079303/eerorika"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570638077,"last_edit_date":1570638077,"creation_date":1570636967,"answer_id":58308095,"question_id":58307897,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58308095","body_markdown":"&gt; How to call the overriden function of parent class in C++?\r\n\r\nYou haven&#39;t actually overridden any function in your example. Only virtual member functions can be overridden, and `display` is non-virtual.\r\n\r\n&gt; I made use of static binding to successfully call the display() member function of the parent class\r\n\r\nYour solution works because there is no overriding or virtual functions involved. Another way to call the hidden member function is to use the scope resolution operator:\r\n\r\n    c.Parent::display();\r\n\r\nThis would use static binding even if the function was virtual.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; What is the purpose of having this line `Parent *p = new Child();`?\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to have any purpose in your program. In general, `new` is used to allocate objects dynamically from the free store.\r\n\r\nNote that the memory will be leaked unless you explicitly deallocate it with `delete`. Also not that `delete p` would have undefined behaviour, because it points to a base whose destructor is non-virtual.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is it a pointer pointing to a constructor?\r\n\r\nNo. `p` points to the dynamic object that was created in the free store.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is the difference between that line and `Parent *p = new Child;`? \r\n\r\nWithout parentheses, you use default initialisation syntax. With empty parentheses you use value initialisation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of trivially constrtuctible classes (such as `Parent`), default initialisation will default initialise the members. In case of integer members, this leaves the members uninitialised. Value initialisation will instead value initialise the members, which for integers means initialisation to zero.\r\n\r\nIn the case of non-trivially constructible classes (such as `Child`), both default and value initialisation invoke the default constructor.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307897/how-to-call-the-overriden-function-of-parent-class-in-c/58308095#58308095","title":"How to call the overriden function of parent class in C++?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12003811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP-vQrQ2_E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rftz6VngIJkF6XSocqGDvoqcLV39Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zZzZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003811/zzzz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12378,"user_id":5494370,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10152989584621642/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alan Birtles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5494370/alan-birtles"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58308095,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570638077,"creation_date":1570636169,"last_edit_date":1570637020,"question_id":58307897,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307897","body_markdown":"The expected output:\r\n\r\n    Child = 2\r\n    Parent = 1\r\n\r\nMy code:\r\n\r\n    class Parent{\r\n        int a;\r\n        public:\r\n            void display(){\r\n                a = 1;\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Parent = &quot; &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class Child:public Parent{\r\n        int b;\r\n        public:\r\n            void display(){\r\n                b = 2;\r\n                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Child = &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n            }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        Parent *p = new Child();\r\n        Child c;\r\n    \r\n        //write your code here\r\n        /* My solution :\r\n          c.display();\r\n          Parent* a = &amp;c;\r\n          a-&gt;display();\r\n        */\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI made use of static binding to successfully call the display() member function of the parent class\r\n\r\nHowever, I wonder if there is any better solution for this question.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of having this line `Parent *p = new Child();`?

Guys I&#39;m getting crazy: HOW CAN I COMPUTE THE everyday residuals in a &#39;FOR&#39;LOOP ?????\r\n\r\nI mean, I tried to:\r\n\r\n  1. make the difference between real y values and reg.predict  \r\n  1. make the manual computation: y_predicted= Intercetta + Hedge*bank_matrix[[&#39;LDO.MI]]\r\n\r\nBut Python always report me problems. I honestly find very hard to understand how Python works for this....\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307870/python-how-to-compute-and-store-residuals-in-a-for-loop-regression","title":"Python How to compute and store Residuals in a FOR-LOOP Regression"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570636626,"post_id":58307868,"comment_id":102977708,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307868/laravel-use-of-undefined-constant-forum-assumed-forum-error#comment102977708_58307868"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11409,"user_id":2263631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WC0BS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Script47","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2263631/script47"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570636613,"post_id":58307922,"comment_id":102977701,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307868/laravel-use-of-undefined-constant-forum-assumed-forum-error/58307922#comment102977701_58307922"},{"owner":{"reputation":5198,"user_id":5581565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIrnt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saly 3301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5581565/saly-3301"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11409,"user_id":2263631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WC0BS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Script47","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2263631/script47"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570636658,"post_id":58307922,"comment_id":102977723,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307868/laravel-use-of-undefined-constant-forum-assumed-forum-error/58307922#comment102977723_58307922"},{"owner":{"reputation":11409,"user_id":2263631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WC0BS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Script47","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2263631/script47"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570636694,"post_id":58307922,"comment_id":102977734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307868/laravel-use-of-undefined-constant-forum-assumed-forum-error/58307922#comment102977734_58307922"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10309028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf3dc9dc4f61d10bf09f8c153363e0de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C.

But this is also rarely to be recommended.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s more usual is, that one script analyzes / parses f1.py, extracts the data  writes some data into a file (e.g. a json file)\r\nand f2.py and f3.py read the data from that file and do then print this data.\r\n\r\nIs there a particular reason you want to have code, that is modifying other python files.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to have f2.py and f3.py modified, then there is another solution, which is called templating (you can for example use Jinji).\r\nIn this case you have two template files f2.py.template and f3.py.template.\r\n\r\nyou write a file parsing f1.py, extracting the data and creates f2.py from f2.py.template and the extracted data. (Same for f3.py.template and f3.py)\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re really 100% sure, that you really want what you ask for.\r\n\r\nYes it is possible:\r\n\r\nyou write a script, tht opens and reads f1.py line by line, looks for the line `&quot;#O = &quot;,` then memorizes the next line.\r\n\r\nThen it reads f2.py line by line and writes it to another file (e.g. next_version_of_f2.py). it reads in a line and writes it out until it encounters the line `#M = &quot;Random string` in f2.py In this case the line will be written out, the desired print will be written out, the print line from f2.py will be read and ignored and then you read and write all the other lines.\r\n\r\nThen you close `f2.py` and `next_version_of_f2.py`, rename f2.py into `f2.py.old` and rename `next_version_of_f2.py` to `f2.py`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307860/run-python-files-and-change-strings-with-1-file/58309122#58309122","title":"Run python files and change strings with 1 file"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":421,"user_id":10135377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f76366adbcfba903266a9d86362771e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ShapeOfMatter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10135377/shapeofmatter"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570641538,"creation_date":1570641538,"answer_id":58309213,"question_id":58307860,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309213","body_markdown":"This is certainly possible but probably inadvisable. \r\n\r\nEditing code should typically be a separate action from executing it (even when we use a single tool that can do both, like a lot of modern IDEs).\r\n\r\n- It suggests a poor workflow. If you want f2.py to `print(&quot;ABCD&quot;)`, then it should be written that way. \r\n- It&#39;s confusing. In order to understand what f2.py does, you have to mentally model the entirety of f1.py and f2.py, _and there&#39;s no indication of this in f2.py_. \r\n- **It invites all kinds of difficult-to-debug situations.** What happens if f1.py is run twice at the same time? What if two _different versions_ of f1.py are run at the same time? Or if I happen to be reading f2.py when you run f1.py? Or if I&#39;m _editing_ f2.py and _save my changes_ while you&#39;re running f1.py?\r\n- It&#39;s a security problem. For f1.py to edit f2.py, the user (shell, web-server, or other surface) calling f1.py has to have edit permissions on f2.py. That means that if they can get f1.py to do something besides what you intended (specifically, if they can get their own text in place of `&quot;ABCD&quot;`), then they can get arbitrary code execution _in everyone else&#39;s runtime!_\r\n\r\nNote that it&#39;s perfectly fine to have code that generates or edits other code. The problem is when a _program_ (possibly spanning multiple files) edits its own _source_. \r\n\r\n[gelonida](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58309122/10135377) discusses some options, which are fine and appropriate for certain contexts such as managing user-specific configuration or building documents. That said, if you&#39;re familiar with functions, variables, imports, and other basics of computer science, then you may not even need a config.json file or a template engine. \r\n\r\n**Reconsider the end result you&#39;re trying to accomplish.** Do some more research/reading, and if you&#39;re still stuck start a new question about the bigger-picture task.

have the following query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT tours_atp.NAME_T, today_atp.TOUR, today_atp.ID1, odds_atp.K1, today_atp.ID2, odds_atp.K2\r\nFROM (players_atp INNER JOIN (players_atp AS players_atp_1 INNER JOIN (today_atp INNER JOIN odds_atp ON (today_atp.TOUR = odds_atp.ID_T_O) AND (today_atp.ID1 = odds_atp.ID1_O) AND (today_atp.ID2 = odds_atp.ID2_O) AND (today_atp.ROUND = odds_atp.ID_R_O)) ON

((today_atp.RESULT)=&quot;&quot;) AND ((players_atp.NAME_P) Not Like &quot;*/*&quot;) AND ((players_atp_1.NAME_P) Not Like &quot;*/*&quot;) AND ((odds_atp.ID_B_O)=2))\r\nORDER BY tours_atp.NAME_T;\r\n```\r\nI&#39;d like to add a field to this query that provides me with the sum of a field in another table (`FS`) with a few criteria applied.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been able to build a stand alone query to get the sum of `FS` by `ID_T` as follows:\r\n```\r\nSELECT tbl_Ts_base_atp.ID_T, Sum(tbl_Ts_mkv_atp.FS) AS SumOfFS\r\nFROM tbl_Ts_base_atp INNER JOIN tbl_Ts_mkv_atp ON tbl_Ts_base_atp.ID_Ts = tbl_Ts_mkv_atp.ID_Ts\r\nWHERE (((tbl_Ts_base_atp.DATE_T)&gt;Date()-2000 And (tbl_Ts_base_atp.DATE_T)&lt;Date()))\r\nGROUP BY tbl_Ts_base_atp.ID_T, tbl_Ts_mkv_atp.ID_Ts;\r\n```\r\nI now want to match up the sum of `FS` from the second query to the records of the first query by `ID_T`. I realise I need to do this using a sub query. I&#39;m confident using these when there&#39;s only one table but I consistently get &#39;syntax errors&#39; when there are joins.\r\n\r\nI simplified the first query down to remove all the `WHERE` conditions so it was easier for me to try and error check but no luck. I guess the resulting SQL will also be easier for you guys to follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT today_atp.TOUR, (SELECT Sum(tbl_Ts_mkv_atp.FS)\r\nFROM tbl_Ts_mkv_atp INNER JOIN (tbl_Ts_base_atp INNER JOIN today_atp ON tbl_Ts_base_atp.ID_T = today_atp.TOUR) ON tbl_Ts_mkv_atp.ID_Ts = tbl_Ts_base_atp.ID_Ts AS tt\r\nWHERE tt.DATE_T&gt;Date()-2000 And tt.DATE_T&lt;Date() AND tt.TOUR=today_atp.TOUR\r\nORDER BY tt.DATE_T) AS SumOfFS\r\nFROM today_atp\r\n```\r\nCan you spot where I&#39;m going wrong? My hunch is that the issue is in the `FROM` line of the sub query but I&#39;m not sure.

For example, the User entity in the example below has to be persisted before resolving the value of the &#39;name&#39; field. Once created, it should be persisted again only when the name field is not null.\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Entity()\r\n     */\r\n    class User\r\n    {\r\n        /**\r\n         * @ORM\\Id()\r\n         * @ORM\\GeneratedValue()\r\n         * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;integer&quot;)\r\n         */\r\n        private $id; //autoincrement\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;string&quot;)\r\n         */\r\n        private $name; //null at the time of creation\r\n\r\n        /**\r\n         * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;date&quot;)\r\n         */\r\n        private $birthday; //null at the time of creation\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPersisting the above entity with the null name field would result in &#39;Column cannot be null&#39; SQL error. Ideally, there would be two separate &quot;NOT NULL ON INSERT&quot; and &quot;NOT NULL ON UPDATE&quot; constraints. Since this is not the case other solutions must be used.\r\n\r\n - A simple solution is to remove &quot;not null&quot; constraint from table to allow null inserts and   \r\n   validate entity on the PHP side to prevent setting null values on update. This approach requires extra effort and care.\r\n - Another solution is to define not null default values that would\r\n   stand    for &#39;undefined&#39;, like $name=&#39;&#39;, $birthday=new Date(&#39;1900-01-01&#39;). But this\r\n   would    require translating these values to empty before using them\r\n   (for    example, displaying a form to set the actual name and date).\r\n - Yet another solution would be to create &quot;EntityData&quot; object and add  \r\n   nullable OneToOne relationship. This is quite cool, because not null constraint is relaxed for the whole group but not individual fields. \r\n   However, this requires creating separate tables/entities for User   \r\n   identity and its contents.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas about how to best handle these cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307814/mysql-doctrine-allowing-null-fields-on-insert-but-not-update","title":"MySQL/Doctrine: allowing null fields on insert, but not update"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","express","post","xmlhttprequest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570637639,"post_id":58307811,"comment_id":102978198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307811/how-to-read-post-request-payload-with-node-js-and-express#comment102978198_58307811"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11353667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ce92cbf9c3b7f2a510e862bb4c43255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vitusverden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11353667/vitusverden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570638701,"post_id":58308309,"comment_id":102978682,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307811/how-to-read-post-request-payload-with-node-js-and-express/58308309#comment102978682_58308309"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11353667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ce92cbf9c3b7f2a510e862bb4c43255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vitusverden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11353667/vitusverden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570638788,"post_id":58308309,"comment_id":102978725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307811/how-to-read-post-request-payload-with-node-js-and-express/58308309#comment102978725_58308309"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11353667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ce92cbf9c3b7f2a510e862bb4c43255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vitusverden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11353667/vitusverden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570640910,"post_id":58308309,"comment_id":102979630,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307811/how-to-read-post-request-payload-with-node-js-and-express/58308309#comment102979630_58308309"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570637741,"creation_date":1570637741,"answer_id":58308309,"question_id":58307811,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58308309","body_markdown":"You need to call `JSON.stringify()` to turn the object into JSON.\r\n\r\n```\r\nxhr.send(JSON.stringify({username: &quot;#{username}&quot;, password: &quot;#{password}&quot;}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10005939/how-do-i-consume-the-json-post-data-in-an-express-application for how to parse the JSON in the node.js code.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307811/how-to-read-post-request-payload-with-node-js-and-express/58308309#58308309","title":"How to read post request payload with node.js and express?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11353667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ce92cbf9c3b7f2a510e862bb4c43255?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vitusverden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11353667/vitusverden"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58308309,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570637741,"creation_date":1570635901,"question_id":58307811,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307811","body_markdown":"Ok, so my js sends a XMLHTTPRequest post every 3 seconds, with username and password as payload.

[solved]\r\n\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t provide any images because this is my first Question and I&#39;d need more reputation","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307809/hierarchal-navigation-in-master-view-of-splitviewcontroller","title":"Hierarchal navigation in master view of splitviewcontroller"},{"tags":["php","command-line"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570635939,"post_id":58307808,"comment_id":102977331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307808/is-it-safe-to-run-a-long-php-script-through-command-line#comment102977331_58307808"},{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570636019,"post_id":58307808,"comment_id":102977377,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58307808/is-it-safe-to-run-a-long-php-script-through-command-line#comment102977377_58307808"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12167751,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e03d384b8558a39815ad66ab9a463e5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ragav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167751/ragav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570636110,"creation_date":1570635893,"last_edit_date":1570636110,"question_id":58307808,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58307808","body_markdown":"I want to run a long PHP script which roughly takes hours to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nI plan to run my script on command line, since the script doesn&#39;t need any webpage access. \r\n\r\n    php mycode.php\r\n\r\nIs it safe to run this way?
