instead of creating separate function for all, you can create one function, for example showCard and pass the parameter like AMEX, VISA, Master\nExample \n\n    showCard(cardName) {\n

the `ModelForm` is initialised, it has an `instance` attribute which is the model instance on which `clean()` will be called. So if you remove `exam_date` from the instance&#39;s `non_empty_fields` dictionary, it won&#39;t use it in `clean`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass IeltsExamForm(ModelForm): \r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.instance.non_empty_fields.pop(&#39;exam_date&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you could do that for each field in `self._meta.exclude`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing that, the attribute `non_empty_fields` should not be a class attribute but an instance property. Modifying the instance&#39;s `non_empty_fields` actually modifies the class attribute (it&#39;s a dictionary so it&#39;s mutable), which will have unintended side-effects (once removed, it&#39;s removed for any subsequent instance you create). Change your model to set the attribute in the init method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass IeltsExam(Model):\r\n    # ...\r\n    # remove the class attribute non_empty_fields\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.non_empty_fields = { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general, I would advise you to only use a `ModelForm` if you&#39;re actually going to save the model, in which case a class attribute is the cleaner approach. Instead of doing all this, if your form isn&#39;t going to save the actual model, you should not use a `ModelForm` but a `Form` and define all fields and cleaning in the form itself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254333/how-to-handle-the-validation-of-the-model-form-when-the-model-has-a-clean-method/58257277#58257277","title":"How to handle the validation of the model form when the model has a clean method if the model form excluded some fields?"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":11065874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUe7Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amin Ba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11065874/amin-ba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":104,"user_id":11065874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUe7Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amin Ba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11065874/amin-ba"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58257277,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570381823,"creation_date":1570337638,"last_edit_date":1570370586,"question_id":58254333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254333","body_markdown":"I have this model:\r\n```\r\nclass IeltsExam(Model):\r\n\r\n    student = OneToOneField(Student, on_delete=CASCADE)\r\n    has_taken_exam = BooleanField(default=False,)\r\n    listening = FloatField(choices=SCORE_CHOICES, null=True, blank=True, )\r\n    reading = FloatField(choices=SCORE_CHOICES, null=True, blank=True, )\r\n    exam_date = DateField(null=True, blank=True, )\r\n\r\n    non_empty_fields = \\\r\n        {\r\n            &#39;listening&#39;: &#39;please enter your listening score&#39;,\r\n            &#39;reading&#39;: &#39;please enter your reading score&#39;,\r\n            &#39;exam_date&#39;: &#39;please specify your exam date&#39;,\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    def clean(self):\r\n        errors = {}\r\n        if self.has_taken_exam:\r\n            for field_name, field_error in self.non_empty_fields.items():\r\n                if getattr(self, field_name) is None:\r\n                    errors[field_name] = field_error\r\n        if errors:\r\n            raise ValidationError(errors)\r\n```\r\nand have this modelform\r\n```\r\nclass IeltsExamForm(ModelForm):\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        model = IeltsExam\r\n        fields = (&#39;has_taken_exam&#39;, &#39;listening&#39;, &#39;reading&#39;, )\r\n```\r\nwhen I submit this form in template, I get the below error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError at /\r\n&#39;ExamForm&#39; has no field named &#39;exam_date&#39;.\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\nDuring handling of the above exception ({&#39;listening&#39;: [&#39;please enter your listening score&#39;], &#39;reading&#39;: [&#39;please enter your reading score&#39;], &#39;exam_date&#39;: [&#39;please specify your exam date&#39;]}), another exception occurred:\r\n```\r\nThe error happens in my view where I am validating the form.\r\nMy database logic is such that I need to have an exam_date field and it should be mandatory to fill if has_taken_exam is checked.

It was just being overridden in my case by the `launchSettings` environment variable declaration.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to use the JSON approach I mentioned in the question, but with something other than the default file name or location, you gotta call `ConfigureHostConfiguration` in your `IHostBuilder` chain and add the file explicitly.\r\n\r\nLike so:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;\r\n    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n        .ConfigureHostConfiguration(\r\n            builder =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                builder.AddJsonFile(&quot;abitraryFileName.json&quot;);\r\n            })\r\n        .ConfigureServices(\r\n            (hostContext, services) =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                services.AddHostedService&lt;Worker&gt;();\r\n                services.Configure&lt;Settings&gt;(\r\n                    hostContext.Configuration.GetSection(&quot;Settings&quot;));\r\n            });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does indeed default to &quot;DOTNET_&quot; as the prefix instead of &quot;ASPNETCORE_&quot;, so make sure both are set on your production machine/VM/service.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254331/how-do-i-set-the-environment-for-a-net-core-3-0-worker-service/58254369#58254369","title":"How do I set the environment for a .NET Core 3.0 Worker Service?"}],"owner":{"reputation":921,"user_id":3986790,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/170c3b034b5a07204e6609260aec65bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"J.D.

Rust references (and most smart pointers like `Box&lt;T&gt;`) are not merely pointers, but *valid* pointers. That is, there are no null references and references must always point to valid data at all times.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to do `self.list = **bx;`, we&#39;re moving the data from `bx` to `self.list`. However, `bx` doesn&#39;t own its data. When the mutable borrow `bx` ends, the actual owner is going to be holding invalid data.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do? The simplest way is what&#39;s sometimes called [Jones&#39; Trick][1] where we switch out the data in `bx` for some dummy value. Now the actual owner of the data in `bx` won&#39;t be holding invalid data. So how do we do this? This is the purview of the function `std::mem::replace` which takes a mutable reference and a value and replaces the data behind the mutable reference with that value, returning what was behind the mutable reference before (including ownership!). That&#39;s exactly what we want to do here with `self.list = std::mem::replace(&amp;mut **bx, List::Nil)`. Again, `List::Nil` is just some dummy data; any `List` at all would work exactly the same.\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum List {\r\n    Cons(u32, Box&lt;List&gt;),\r\n    Nil,\r\n}\r\nstruct ListHolder {\r\n    list: List,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Iterator for ListHolder {\r\n    type Item = u32;\r\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;u32&gt; {\r\n        if let Cons(num, bx) = &amp;mut self.list {\r\n            let val = *num;\r\n            self.list = std::mem::replace(&amp;mut **bx, List::Nil); // This is the key line\r\n            Some(val)\r\n        } else {\r\n            None\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nuse List::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let list_inst = ListHolder {\r\n        list: Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil)))))),\r\n    };\r\n    for i in list_inst.into_iter() {\r\n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i); // Prints 1, 2, 3 as expected\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[(playground)][2]\r\n\r\nTo be slightly more idiomatic, instead of `&amp;mut **bx`, we could simply use `bx.as_mut()` to get a mutable reference from the box. Also, the `into_iter` call on `list_inst` is unnecessary since `ListHolder` already implements `Iterator` so it doesn&#39;t need to be turned into one. You may also be wondering about `num` and `val` and why we still have to make a temporary variable for that.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that this value is still just a reference and we don&#39;t have owned access to the owner (`self.list`). That means we have to make a copy of it to return. `u32` implements `Copy` so this isn&#39;t really a problem, but if you tried to make the linked list generic in the type of its elements, it simply wouldn&#39;t work. `let val = *num;` is the same kind of &quot;moving out of borrowed content&quot; that we couldn&#39;t do before.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use `std::mem::replace` to get ownership not just of the data behind `bx`, but of the whole list. So if we use `std::mem::replace(&amp;mut self.list, List::Nil)` before destructuring, `self.list` will be replaced with a dummy value and we&#39;ll have ownership of the actual list, including both the value and the tail of the list. This also means that we can just have `self.list = *bx`, as I&#39;m sure you originally wanted.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl Iterator for ListHolder {\r\n    type Item = u32;\r\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;u32&gt; {\r\n        if let Cons(num, bx) = std::mem::replace(&amp;mut self.list, List::Nil) {\r\n            self.list = *bx;\r\n            Some(num)\r\n        } else {\r\n            None\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[(playground)][3]\r\n\r\nThe upshot is now you can [make the list generic][4] with hardly any effort.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about how Rust&#39;s ownership model affects the implementation of linked lists, you can do no better than the excellent series [*Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists*][5].

Let&#39;s also say I want to provide some type-level guarantees that we aren&#39;t able to launch nuclear missiles in the midst of using these computations, so we use `polysemy` and wrap all these up into its own DSL `Library`. We can naively interpret this with\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nrunLibraryIO :: Member (Embed IO) r =&gt; Sem (Library &#39;: r) a -&gt; Sem r a\r\nrunLibraryIO = interpret $ \\case\r\n  Computation -&gt; embed computation\r\n  -- ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is all well and good, but `computation` can throw exceptions! We quickly throw up some code and are able to lift a **single** type of exception into `polysemy`. We write the helper\r\n\r\n```\r\nwithIOError :: forall e r a . (Exception e, Members &#39;[Embed IO, Error e] r) =&gt; IO a -&gt; Sem r a\r\nwithIOError action = do\r\n  res &lt;- embed $ try action\r\n  case res of\r\n       Left e  -&gt; throw @e e\r\n       Right x -&gt; pure x\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then our interpreter becomes\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nrunLibraryIO :: Members &#39;[Embed IO, Error MyException] r =&gt; Sem (Library &#39;: r) a -&gt; Sem r a\r\nrunLibraryIO = interpret $ withIOError @MyException . \\case\r\n  Computation -&gt; computation\r\n  -- ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut we quickly notice this is not extensible. In particular, we are only able to lift a single type of exception, and it&#39;s limited to computations in `IO`. We cannot dive arbitrarily deep into a monad that contains exceptions and transfer it out in a nice and pure manner. If for whatever reason we discover a corner case where `computation` may throw `MyException&#39;`, we have no way of inserting support for this and catching it elsewhere in our code!\r\n\r\nIs there something I am missing in the library that allows me to do this? Am I stuck with dealing with exceptions in `IO`? Some guidance on where to go forward from here and make this sufficiently polymorphic would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254304/extracting-multiple-io-exceptions-into-polysemy","title":"Extracting multiple IO exceptions into polysemy"},{"tags":["java"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":12044023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2ab0a4b48fae3731e21e928fc2d26dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"McLP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12044023/mclp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":65,"user_id":12044023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2ab0a4b48fae3731e21e928fc2d26dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"McLP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12044023/mclp"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570398496,"last_edit_date":1570398496,"creation_date":1570338362,"answer_id":58254385,"question_id":58254302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58254385","body_markdown":"First of all, if you don&#39;t know how many names you will have, use a List.\r\nThen you must loop over all Strings when displaying so will display all of them.

nameList = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;();\r\n\r\n    while (true) {  // Repeat forever\r\n        int choice = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;[1] Insert Name\\n[2] Display Names&quot;));\r\n\r\n        if (choice == 1) \r\n            nameList.add(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;Insert Your Name: &quot;));\r\n\r\n        if (choice == 2) \r\n            for (String name: nameList)  // loop over all strings in the list\r\n                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Name: &quot;+ name);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote however, that you need to `import java.util.LinkedList;` for this to work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254302/how-to-input-and-output-names-in-joptionpane-in-java/58254385#58254385","title":"How to input and output names in JOptionPane in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12012567,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37fd7f1b6bc91b450fc03f2da667352e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Miao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12012567/miao"},"last_editor":{"reputation":553,"user_id":8902167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DlWmB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anil M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8902167/anil-m"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570398496,"creation_date":1570337236,"last_edit_date":1570346194,"question_id":58254302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254302","body_markdown":"I am making a program that inputs and outputs names using `JOptionPane`.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do if I am done inputting the name to automatically go back to the menu and pick a choice again so I can choose and view my inputted name in my display name section?\r\n\r\n```\r\nint choice = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;[1] Insert Name\\n[2] Display Name&quot;));\r\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Names: &quot;+values[i]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void main (String args []) {\r\n\r\n    String [] values = new String [10];\r\n\tint choice = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;[1] Insert Name\\n[2] Display Name&quot;));\r\n\t\r\n\tif (choice == 1) {\r\n\t\tfor (int i = 0;

Writing the feed-forward test was pretty straight forward, but I have no idea how to implement the test for gradients.\r\n\r\nI found out there is a function in the tensorflow test package called `compute_gradient` but I can&#39;t find any resource on how to use it. The documentation basically says it computes the gradients (jacobian matrix) which is what I want, but when I try to use it, I get `EagerTensor is not callable`\r\n\r\nThis I the code that fails:\r\n```python\r\nclass LayerGradientTest(tf.test.TestCase):\r\n    def test_gradient(self):\r\n        with self.test_session():\r\n            input_tensor = [...]\r\n            expected_output = [...]\r\n            expected_gradients = [...]\r\n            test_layer = MyLayer()\r\n            output_tensor = test_layer(tf.Variable(input_tensor))\r\n            grad_computed = tf.test.compute_gradient(output_tensor, expected_output)\r\n            self.assertAllEqual(grad_computed, expected_gradients)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the test to either pass or fail at the assertion but I get a\r\n`TypeError: &#39;tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor&#39; object is not callable` from `compute_gradient`\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nOf course gradients need a loss function, I&#39;m an idiot... but still the output is of nonsense shape. I now use the following code:\r\n```python\r\nfunction = tf.losses.mean_squared_error\r\ngrad_computed = tf.test.compute_gradient(function, [output_tensor, expected_output])\r\n```\r\nThe input&#39;s shapes to my layer are (1, 2, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 2, 2) but the gradients are a zip object of 4 12x4 matrices but since I have no parameters in my layer I expected to get the error values at the input. Please correct me if I messed something up again. Just to clarify, my layer is just transforming data and therefore has no gradients on its own but must propagate them backwards

an object file is not useful by itself.  I can&#39;t be run, and it can&#39;t be used except to link to other object files to make a program.\r\n\r\nYou probably want a &quot;shared object&quot; file, or a `.so` file, if you want to build a library.  Or, if you are keen to have the library statically linked, you might want a &quot;library file&quot;, or a `.la` file.\r\n\r\nAutomake uses Libtool to build both kinds of library files, but it can get complicated.  That&#39;s because these library files are a bit different across multiple platforms, and automake/libtool attempts to handle the platform differences for you.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the above information isn&#39;t what you need, and you really want to install the `.o` file, then you should add the following to your `Makefile.am`\r\n\r\n    somethingdir = /path/to/where/you/want/the/file\r\n    something_DATA = the_file.o\r\n\r\nThis treats the object file as a data file, and installs the data file at the chosen path.\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#39;m nearly certain that this is not what you really need, but at least you do know how to install an object file.  \r\n\r\nWhat you probably need is one of:\r\n\r\n1. Build the object file into an executable, and install that executable\r\n2. Build the object file into a shared object library, and install that library\r\n3. Build the object file into a library archive (that&#39;s an .la file), and install that library archive.\r\n\r\nas plain object files, `.o` files, cannot easily be used without the required header files used to build them, and often the Makefiles and build system used to build them too.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254275/how-do-i-compile-and-install-an-individual-object-file-with-automake/58254439#58254439","title":"How do I compile and install an individual object file with Automake?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570340679,"creation_date":1570340679,"answer_id":58254559,"question_id":58254275,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58254559","body_markdown":"What I ended up doing is this:\r\n\r\n    crtdir = $(libdir)\r\n    crt_DATA = crt1.o Scrt1.o crti.o crtn.o\r\n    \r\n    crt1.o: $(top_srcdir)/src/crt/crt1.c\r\n            $(CC) -c -fno-PIC $(AM_CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^\r\n    \r\n    Scrt1.o: $(top_srcdir)/src/crt/crt1.c\r\n            $(CC) -c -fPIC $(AM_CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^\r\n    \r\n    crti.o: $(top_srcdir)/arch/$(ARCH)/src/crt/crti.s\r\n            $(CCAS) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^\r\n    \r\n    crtn.o: $(top_srcdir)/arch/$(ARCH)/src/crt/crtn.s\r\n            $(CCAS) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^\r\n\r\nOf course, the tabs and spaces are messed up, but still.\r\n\r\nCredit to @EdwinBuck for his answer, the inspiration for mine!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254275/how-do-i-compile-and-install-an-individual-object-file-with-automake/58254559#58254559","title":"How do I compile and install an individual object file with Automake?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58254439,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570340679,"creation_date":1570336904,"last_edit_date":1570339454,"question_id":58254275,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254275","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking to build and install an object file (`crt1.o`, a C startup file) into the library directory (`/usr/lib`) with Automake and Autoconf.\r\n\r\nSo, my initial though about doing this was to create a `crt_DATA` variable inside the `Makefile.am` file, and define special targets on how to build the file.

I&#39;m actually going to make these strings for now, just because it removes some complexity and it&#39;s not clear what your actual output should be if they&#39;re not, but it&#39;s fairly easy to reason upwards about this.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nas, bs, cs = &#39;abc&#39;, &#39;def&#39;, &#39;ghi&#39;\r\n\r\npossible = []\r\n\r\nfor a in as:\r\n    for b in bs:\r\n        for c in cs:\r\n            possible.append([a, b, c])\r\n\r\nassert possible == [[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;g&#39;], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;i&#39;], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;g&#39;], ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that this sort of &quot;chain&quot; for loop is a common enough application that it is implemented in the standard library as `itertools.product`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\n# assume as, bs, cs, and possible are defined as above\r\n\r\nfor a, b, c in itertools.product(as, bs, cs):\r\n    possible.append([a, b, c])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed this sort of &quot;iterate over a collection and build a new list from it&quot; is common enough that list comprehensions are a concept not just in Python but many other languages too. In Python the syntax looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\n# as, bs, and cs are defined as above\r\n\r\npossible = [[a, b, c] for a, b, c in itertools.product(as, bs, cs)]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254271/how-do-i-use-pythons-pop-and-append-to-create-series-of-variable-lists/58254311#58254311","title":"How do I use python&#39;s pop and append to create series of variable lists?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":12135112,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7SZPUQif_oQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD-4/_BqRFh2bIWM/photo.jpg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Nisan Abeywickrama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135112/nisan-abeywickrama"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53,"user_id":12135112,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7SZPUQif_oQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD-4/_BqRFh2bIWM/photo.jpg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Nisan Abeywickrama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135112/nisan-abeywickrama"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570338977,"last_edit_date":1570338977,"creation_date":1570338011,"answer_id":58254361,"question_id":58254271,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58254361","body_markdown":"  I changed the list to have only 1 index.

to write a single file while reading from multiple input streams of the exact same file from diffrent locations with NodeJS. \r\n\r\n## As its still not Clear Maybe?\r\nI want to use more performance for the download lets say we have 2 locations for the same file each can perform only 10mb down stream so i want to download a part from the first location and the secund in parallel. to get it with 20mb.\r\n\r\nso both streams need to get joined some how and both streams need to know the range they are downloading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni have 2 examples\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar http = require(&#39;http&#39;)\r\nvar fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;)\r\n\r\n// will write to disk __dirname/file1.zip\r\nfunction writeFile(fileStream){\r\n  //...\r\n}\r\n// This example assums downloading from 2 http locations\r\nhttp.request(&#39;http://location1/file1.zip&#39;).pipe(writeFile)\r\nhttp.request(&#39;http://location2/file1.zip&#39;).pipe(writeFile)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;)\r\n\r\n// will write to disk __dirname/file1.zip\r\nfunction writeFile(fileStream){\r\n  //...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// this example is reading the same file from 2 diffrent

work\r\n\r\n\r\nReadStream needs to check if a defined content range is already writen befor rereading the next chunk from each file and maybe they should start in on a random location in the file to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nif the total file content length is X we will divide it into smaller chunks and create a map where each entry has a fixed content length so we know what parts we got and what parts we are downloading in total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Trying to answer this question my self\r\nWe can try to simply optimistic raise Read\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet SIZE = 64; // 64 byte intervals\r\nlet buffers = []\r\nlet bytesRead = 0  \r\n\r\nfunction readParallel(filepath,callback){\r\nfs.open(filepath, &#39;r&#39;, function(err, fd) {\r\n  fs.fstat(fd, function(err, stats) {\r\n    let bufferSize = stats.size;\r\n\r\n\r\n    while (bytesRead &lt; bufferSize) {\r\n      let size = Math.min(SIZE, bufferSize - bytesRead);\r\n      let buffer = new Buffer(size),\r\n      let position = bytesRead\r\n      let length = size\r\n      let offset = bytesRead\r\n\r\n\r\n      let read = fs.readSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position);\r\n      buffers.push(buffer);  \r\n      bytesRead += read;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n  });\r\n});\r\n}\r\n// At the End: buffers.concat() ==== &quot;File Content&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nfs.createReadStream() has an option you can pass it to specify the start \r\n```\r\nlet f = fs.createReadStream(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, {start: 1000});\r\n```\r\nYou could also open a normal file descriptor with `fs.open()`, then `fs.read()` one byte from a position right before where you want the stream to be positioned using the position argument to `fs.read()` and then you can pass that file descriptor into `fs.createReadStream()` as an option and the stream will start with that file descriptor and position (though obviously the `start` option to `fs.createReadStream()` is a bit simpler).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254238/how-to-write-a-single-file-while-reading-from-multiple-input-streams-in-nodejs","title":"How to write a single file while reading

String literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter `r&#39; or &#39;R&#39;; such strings are called raw strings and use different rules for backslash escape sequences.\r\n\r\nUnless an &#39;r&#39; or &#39;R&#39; prefix is present, escape sequences in strings are interpreted according to rules similar to those used by Standard C.\r\n\r\nIn strict compatibility with Standard C, up to three octal digits are accepted, but an unlimited number of hex digits is taken to be part of the hex escape (and then the lower 8 bits of the resulting hex number are used in 8-bit implementations).\r\n\r\nUnlike Standard C, all unrecognized escape sequences are left in the string unchanged, i.e., the backslash is left in the string. (This behavior is useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped, the resulting output is more easily recognized as broken.)\r\n\r\nWhen an &#39;r&#39; or &#39;R&#39; prefix is present, backslashes are still used to quote the following character, but all backslashes are left in the string. For example, the string literal r&quot;\\n&quot; consists of two characters: a backslash and a lowercase `n&#39;. String quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the string; for example, r&quot;\\&quot;&quot; is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; r&quot;\\&quot; is not a value string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the string, not as a line continuation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254234/how-does-python-interpret-backslash-in-string/58254265#58254265","title":"How does Python interpret backslash in string?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11532095,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2263026580442851/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sudhansu Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11532095/sudhansu-kumar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570340160,"creation_date":1570340160,"answer_id":58254514,"question_id":58254234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58254514","body_markdown":"For the first pattern\r\n```&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\]&#39;```\r\n```\\``` is not escaped so in the output one more ```\\``` is added to escape it. \r\nFor the second pattern\r\n```&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\]&#39;``` \r\n```\\``` is already escaped in the pattern so no new ```\\``` in the output.\r\nFor the third pattern\r\n```&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\\\]&#39;``` first ```\\``` is escaping the second ```\\``` and third\r\n```\\``` is being escaped by adding one more ```\\``` in the output.

Single backslash produces double backslashes. Double backslashes produce Double backslashes. Triple backslashes produce quadruple backslashes.....\r\n\r\nTo be clear: your first output is a string with **one** backslash in it. Python displays two backslashes in its **representation of** the string.\r\n\r\nWhen you input the string with a single backslash, Python does not treat the sequence `\\]` in the input as any special escape sequence, and therefore the `\\` is turned into an actual backslash in the actual string, and the `]` into a closing square bracket. Quoting from the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals) linked by Klaus D.:\r\n\r\n&gt;Unlike Standard C, all unrecognized escape sequences are left in the string unchanged, i.e., *the backslash is left in the result*. (This behavior is useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped, the resulting output is more easily recognized as broken.)\r\n\r\nWhen you input the string with a double backslash, the sequence `\\\\` is an escape sequence for a **single** backslash, and then the `]` is just a `]`.\r\n\r\nEither way, when Python displays the string back to you, it uses `\\\\` for the single actual backslash, because it does not look ahead to determine that a single backslash would work - the backslash always gets escaped.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo go into a little more detail: Python doesn&#39;t care about how you specified the string in the first place - it has a specific &quot;normalized&quot; form that depends only on what the string actually contains. We can see this by playing around with the different ways to quote a string:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;foo&#39;\r\n    &#39;foo&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;foo&quot;\r\n    &#39;foo&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; r&#39;foo&#39;\r\n    &#39;foo&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;foo&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    &#39;foo&#39;\r\n\r\nThe normalized form will use double quotes if that avoids escape sequences for single quotes:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;\\&#39;\\&#39;\\&#39;&#39;\r\n    &quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\nBut it will switch back to single quotes if the string contains both types of quote:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;\\&#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n    &#39;\\&#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&#39;\\&quot;&#39;\r\n    &#39;\\&#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n\r\n(Exercise: how many characters are actually in this string, and what are they? How many backslashes does the string contain?)\r\n\r\n&gt;! It contains two characters - a single-quote and a double-quote - and **no** backslashes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254234/how-does-python-interpret-backslash-in-string/58254632#58254632","title":"How does Python interpret backslash in string?"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":11814543,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5066c00f7e8acb49f3ec430b643f6f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jalene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11814543/jalene"},"last_editor":{"reputation":40972,"user_id":523612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ae512dd708a619496d36b1f681f95e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Karl Knechtel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/523612/karl-knechtel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58254632,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570341549,"creation_date":1570336393,"last_edit_date":1570340873,"question_id":58254234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254234","body_markdown":"Although I noticed the pattern but how does the backslash work in string theoretically? \r\n\r\n\r\n    &#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\]&#39;\r\n**output**: `&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\]&#39;`\r\n\r\n    &#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\]&#39;\r\n**output**: `&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\]&#39;`\r\n\r\n    &#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\\\]&#39;\r\n**output**: `&#39;@#2_#]&amp;*^%$\\\\\\\\]&#39;`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254234/how-does-python-interpret-backslash-in-string","title":"How does Python interpret backslash in string?"},{"tags":["python","xml","ms-word","zipfile"],"owner":{"reputation":490,"user_id":2600860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfuQl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ali Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2600860/ali-asad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570336385,"creation_date":1570336385,"question_id":58254232,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254232","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to extract heading, subheadings, and paragraphs from a word document.

When you are calling `addSnapshotListener` for [listening to realtime updates](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen#listen_to_multiple_documents_in_a_collection), it means that you attach a listener that gets called for every change that takes place in your database.

same.\r\n\r\n    try\r\n            {\r\n                using (\r\n                    var connection =\r\n                        new

You want to delete the files you created.\r\n\t- The files are put in a shared folder.\r\n\t- The files include the files which were created by several users.\r\n\t- The files you want to delete are as follows.\r\n\t\t- Files which were created 3 hours ago. In this case, there are the files which are created by you and other users.\r\n\t\t- For the files which were created 3 hours ago, you want to leave only the latest file.\r\n\t\t- While you follow the above condition, you want to delete only the files you created.\r\n- You want to achieve this using Google Apps Script.\r\n\r\nFrom your script and question, I could understand like this. If my understanding is correct, how about this answer? Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\n## Modification points:\r\n- In your situation, when `&quot;email&quot; in owners` for the search query as `and` is added, only the files you created are returned. By this, your goal cannot be achieved. So `var files = folder.searchFiles(&#39;modifiedDate &lt; &quot;&#39; + cutOffDate + &#39;&quot;&#39;);` is required to be used.\r\n\r\nIn this case, how about checking the owner at `fileIDs.forEach(function(fileID) {Drive.Files.remove(fileID)}`?\r\n\r\n## Pattern 1:\r\nIn this pattern, the emails of owners are retrieved, and when the files are deleted, the owner is checked and deleted it. By this, only the files you created can be deleted.\r\n\r\n### Modified script:\r\nPlease modify the function of `getOldFileIDs()` and `deleteFiles()` as follows.\r\n\r\n\tfunction getOldFileIDs() {\r\n\t  // Old date is 3 Hours\r\n\t  var oldDate = new Date().getTime() - 3600*1000*3;\r\n\t  var cutOffDate = new Date(oldDate).toISOString();\r\n\r\n\t  // Get folderID using the URL on google drive\r\n\t  var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(&#39;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&#39;);\r\n\t  var files = folder.searchFiles(&#39;modifiedDate &lt; &quot;&#39; + cutOffDate + &#39;&quot;&#39;);\r\n\r\n\t  var obj = [];\r\n\t  while (files.hasNext()) {\r\n\t    var file = files.next();\r\n\t    obj.push({id: file.getId(), date: file.getDateCreated(), owner: file.getOwner().getEmail()}); // Modified\r\n\t  }\r\n\t  obj.sort(function(a, b) {\r\n\t    var a= new Date(a.date).valueOf();\r\n\t    var b= new Date(b.date).valueOf();\r\n\t    return b-a;\r\n\t  });\r\n\t  obj.shift();\r\n\t  return obj; // Modified\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tfunction deleteFiles() {\r\n\t  var email = &quot;###&quot;; // Added\r\n\t  var obj = getOldFileIDs; // Modified\r\n\t  obj.forEach(function(e) { // Modified\r\n\t    if (e.owner == email) { // Added\r\n\t      Drive.Files.remove(e.id); // Modified\r\n\t    }\r\n\t  });\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n- When you use this script, please set your email address to `var email = &quot;###&quot;`. Or you can also use `var email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()`.\r\n\r\n## Pattern 2:\r\nWhen the files that you are not owner are deleted, an error occurs.

This seems like a variation on the bin packing problem, but I want to keep all &quot;boxes&quot; of same event contiguously grouped.\r\n\r\nAt first glance this looks like a simple bin packing problem, but it has the added wrinkle that all the spaces for one event should all be together. I found a paper (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bfda/557b3f1cfc43664cc8142367f4da96e1ba70.pdf) that uses package destination as another variable. It might be analogous to my keep them together requirement. But I&#39;m looking for ideas of either algorithms or (even better) some existing implementation of libraries (preferably node.js or C#).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n- Say there is a room with 4 rows of tables each 4ft wide and 42ft long.\r\n- Event Foo requires 15 sets of 4ftx7ft play spaces\r\n- Event Bar requires 12 sets of 4ftx4ft play spaces\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI could fit 6 Foo areas in one of my 42 rows, so 15 sets would take 2 full rows and 14ft of a 3rd row (leaving 28ft). I can fit 8 Bar areas in one 42ft row, the remaining 4 would take 16 ft. So, I can fit all of these events in my room and have a 4ft x 12ft space to spare.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to programmatically do this kind of calculation so I can do it at scale for many rooms and dozens of events.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d also gladly take a software recommendation if there is a product that already does this kind of thing, but I haven&#39;t been able to fine any after moderate

You can lock the file using the answers from the other question.\r\n\r\nHowever I&#39;m having trouble where this is allowing me to read the file, but not write to it afterward without first unlocking the file.  That is, *the recommended method, which seems to be fairly well-respected, is locking the **same** thread out of its own resource*.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing (var fs = new FileStream(GetJsonPath(), FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite,\r\n        FileShare.None))\r\n{\r\n\tSomeDtoType dto;\r\n\tusing (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(fs))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tdto = ((SomeDtoType)(new JsonSerializer()).Deserialize(reader,\r\n                typeof(SomeDtoType)));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Make changes to the DTO.....\r\n\r\n\tusing (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(fs))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tnew JsonSerializer().Serialize(writer, dto);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `using` line that creates the `StreamWriter` throws the following exception:\r\n\r\n&gt;Stream was not writable.\r\n\r\nNow one thing that comes to mind is the value of `FileShare.None`.  The problem here is that that particular enum is evidently setting lock permissions for more than just external processes.\r\n\r\n*How can you lock external threads/processes out of changing/deleting the file, yet allow your own to make these two subsequent read/write accesses?*\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nEvidently moving everything into the `using` block for the `StreamReader`, then setting `fs.Position` to `0` between the read and the write kind of fixes the issue.  The `fs.Position` part is fine, but having to move the write logic into the `using` block for the `StreamReader`, just so they can both use the same `FileStream` lock, seems a tad odd...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254204/how-do-you-lock-a-file-in-c-without-making-it-unwritable-after-first-being-read","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How do you lock a file in C# without making it unwritable after first being read?"},{"tags":["python","scikit-learn"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":9911266,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbfAv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ethan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9911266/ethan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570377818,"post_id":58255836,"comment_id":102886658,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254203/custom-binning-in-sklearn-preprocessing/58255836#comment102886658_58255836"},{"owner":{"reputation":6787,"user_id":6347629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxdJr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Venkatachalam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":63,"user_id":9911266,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbfAv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ethan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9911266/ethan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570425324,"post_id":58255836,"comment_id":102895586,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254203/custom-binning-in-sklearn-preprocessing/58255836#comment102895586_58255836"},{"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":9911266,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zbfAv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ethan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9911266/ethan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570679588,"post_id":58255836,"comment_id":102990890,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254203/custom-binning-in-sklearn-preprocessing/58255836#comment102990890_58255836"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6787,"user_id":6347629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxdJr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Venkatachalam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6347629/venkatachalam"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570353378,"creation_date":1570353378,"answer_id":58255836,"question_id":58254203,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58255836","body_markdown":"I would recommend using the [PowerTransformer()][1].

Is there any other way to do this with `sklearn.preprocessing`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254203/custom-binning-in-sklearn-preprocessing","title":"Custom binning in sklearn.preprocessing?"},{"tags":["elasticsearch"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570340866,"last_edit_date":1570340866,"creation_date":1570340528,"answer_id":58254550,"question_id":58254201,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58254550","body_markdown":"Term queries are to be used on [keyword][1] fields in order to get the exact match.\r\n\r\nFrom the above link, we have the below for `keyword` datatype:\r\n\r\n&gt; They are typically used for filtering (Find me all blog posts where\r\n&gt; status is published), for sorting, and for aggregations. Keyword\r\n&gt; fields are only searchable by their exact value.\r\n\r\nFrom your mapping, the field `name` has sibling field which is `name.keyword` which is of type `keyword`. \r\n\r\nModify your term query to make use of it as below and it would give you the desired result. \r\n\r\n    GET /product/_search\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;from&quot;: 0,\r\n      &quot;size&quot; : 1000,\r\n      &quot;query&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;term&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;name.keyword&quot;: {                  &lt;---- Note this\r\n            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Wine - Ice Wine&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhile on the other hand, the `match` query you make use of on `text` field goes through the [Analysis][2] phase. \r\n\r\nBasically when you have a field of text type and when you ingest a document it converts the sentences into tokens, converts them into small case letters and thereby stores in the inverted index. This would be [index time analysis][3]\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens when you use a match query i.e. whatever you add in the query part, it breaks down into individual words or tokens and searches them in inverted index. This is [search time analysis][6]. \r\n\r\nThe analysis is done by concept called [Analyzers][4]. By default it makes use of [Standard Analyzer][5]. \r\n\r\nI&#39;d suggest you go through the links to understand more on this. \r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/keyword.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html#_index_time_analysis\r\n  [4]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html\r\n  [5]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-analyzer.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html#_search_time_analysis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254201/match-and-term-giving-different-results-on-text-field-elasticsearch/58254550#58254550","title":"match and term giving different results on text field elasticsearch"}],"owner":{"reputation":1101,"user_id":6703569,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SEU_x8PjYg4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/9Ht4S0ndBuI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bhawan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6703569/bhawan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58254550,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570340866,"creation_date":1570336044,"question_id":58254201,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254201","body_markdown":"I am learning elasticsearch-7.4.0 and working with basic queries.\r\n\r\nI have a `product` index which has a field `name` with the following mapping:\r\n\r\n    &quot;name&quot; : {\r\n      &quot;type&quot; : &quot;text&quot;,\r\n      &quot;fields&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;keyword&quot; : {\r\n          &quot;type&quot; : &quot;keyword&quot;,\r\n          &quot;ignore_above&quot; : 256\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I am executing the term query to match documents with name &quot;`Wine - Ice Wine`&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GET /product/_search\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;from&quot;: 0,\r\n      &quot;size&quot; : 1000,\r\n      &quot;query&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;term&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Wine - Ice Wine&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe output I am getting:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;took&quot; : 0,\r\n      &quot;timed_out&quot; : false,\r\n      &quot;_shards&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;total&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;successful&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;skipped&quot; : 0,\r\n        &quot;failed&quot; : 0\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;hits&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;total&quot; : {\r\n          &quot;value&quot; : 0,\r\n          &quot;relation&quot; : &quot;eq&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;max_score&quot; : null,\r\n        &quot;hits&quot; : [ ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen I am running match query:\r\n\r\n    GET /product/_search\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;from&quot;: 0,\r\n      &quot;size&quot; : 1000,\r\n      &quot;query&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;match&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Wine - Ice Wine&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe output I am getting:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;took&quot; : 0,\r\n      &quot;timed_out&quot; : false,\r\n      &quot;_shards&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;total&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;successful&quot; : 1,\r\n        &quot;skipped&quot; : 0,\r\n        &quot;failed&quot; : 0\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;hits&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;total&quot; : {\r\n          &quot;value&quot; : 75,\r\n          &quot;relation&quot; : &quot;eq&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;max_score&quot; : 12.354952,\r\n        &quot;hits&quot; : [\r\n          {\r\n            &quot;_index&quot; : &quot;product&quot;,\r\n            &quot;_type&quot; : &quot;doc&quot;,\r\n            &quot;_id&quot; : &quot;403&quot;,\r\n            &quot;_score&quot; : 12.354952,\r\n            &quot;_source&quot; : {\r\n              &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Wine - Ice Wine&quot;,\r\n              &quot;price&quot; : 127,\r\n              &quot;in_stock&quot; : 26,\r\n              &quot;sold&quot; : 334,\r\n              &quot;tags&quot; : [\r\n                &quot;Alcohol&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Wine&quot;\r\n              ],\r\n              &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Nulla neque libero, convallis eget, eleifend luctus, ultricies eu, nibh.

Because the corresponding information in observations of File 1 is not complete, I&#39;m thinking of using fuzzy matching to back out their PID as many as possible (of course the level accuracy should be taken into account). For example, the observations with FNAME &quot;Paul&quot; and LNAME &quot;Row&quot; in File 1 should be assigned the same PID because there is only one similar observation in File 2. But for the observations with FNAME &quot;Marc&quot; and LNAME &quot;Robert&quot;, ```Marc,MS,Robert,M,2000,201211.0``` should be assigned PID &quot;S1&quot;, ```Marc,H,Robert,M,2000,201211.0``` PID &quot;S0&quot; and ```Marc,M,Robert,M,,201211.0``` either &quot;S0&quot; or &quot;S1&quot;. \r\n\r\nSince I want to compensate File 1&#39;s PID as many as possible while keeping high accuracy, I consider three steps. First, use command to make sure that  if and only if those information in FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER, and DOB are all completely matched, observations in File 1 can be assigned a PID. The output should be \r\n```\r\nD,FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER,DOB,snapshot,PID\r\n2,66M,J,Rock,F,1995,201211.0,S2\r\n3,David,HM,Lee,M,,201211.0,\r\n6,66M,,Rock,F,,201211.0,\r\n0,David,H M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,\r\n3,Marc,H,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,\r\n6,Marc,M,Robert,M,,201211.0,\r\n6,Marc,MS,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,\r\n3,David,M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,\r\n5,Paul,ABC,Row,F,2008,201211.0,\r\n3,Paul,ACB,Row,,,201211.0,\r\n4,David,,Lee,,1990,201211.0,\r\n4,66,J,Rock,,1995,201211.0,\r\n```\r\nNext, write another command to guarantee that while DOB information are completely same, use fuzzy matching for FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER to back out File 1&#39;s observations&#39; PID, which is not identified in the first step. So the output through these two steps is supposed to be \r\n```\r\nD,FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER,DOB,snapshot,PID\r\n2,66M,J,Rock,F,1995,201211.0,S2\r\n3,David,HM,Lee,M,,201211.0,\r\n6,66M,,Rock,F,,201211.0,\r\n0,David,H M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n3,Marc,H,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,S0\r\n6,Marc,M,Robert,M,,201211.0,\r\n6,Marc,MS,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,S1\r\n3,David,M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n5,Paul,ABC,Row,F,2008,201211.0,S6\r\n3,Paul,ACB,Row,,,201211.0,\r\n4,David,,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n4,66,J,Rock,,1995,201211.0,S2\r\n```\r\nIn the final step, use a new command to do fuzzy matching for all related columns, namely FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER, and DOB to compensate the remained observations&#39; PID. So the final output is expected to be \r\n```\r\nD,FNAME,MNAME,LNAME,GENDER,DOB,snapshot,PID\r\n2,66M,J,Rock,F,1995,201211.0,S2\r\n3,David,HM,Lee,M,,201211.0,S3\r\n6,66M,,Rock,F,,201211.0,S2\r\n0,David,H M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n3,Marc,H,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,S0\r\n6,Marc,M,Robert,M,,201211.0,S1\r\n6,Marc,MS,Robert,M,2000,201211.0,S1\r\n3,David,M,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n5,Paul,ABC,Row,F,2008,201211.0,S6\r\n3,Paul,ACB,Row,,,201211.0,S6\r\n4,David,,Lee,,1990,201211.0,S3\r\n4,66,J,Rock,,1995,201211.0,S2\r\n```\r\nI need to keep the order of File 1&#39;s observations so it must be kind of leftouter join. Because my original data size is about 100Gb, I want to use Linux to deal with my issue. \r\nBut I have no idea how to complete the last two steps through ```awk``` or any other command in Linux. Is there anyone who can give me a favor?

In the best case, each section is started with a paragraph having one of the **Heading {n}** styles, like &quot;Heading 1&quot; and &quot;Heading 2&quot;. Then you can just proceed through the paragraphs checking each for one of those styles and populate your hierarchy accordingly. There are good reasons why an author might stick to this discipline because it makes forming a table-of-contents (TOC) much easier.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you&#39;ll need to look for other reliable markers indicating the start of a new section.\r\n\r\nNote that Word also has a concept of &quot;section&quot; which is quite different than how I&#39;m using the word here. In Word, a section is a contiguous block of pages that share the same page format (like margins, portrait/landscape, etc.). In publishing parlance, a section is a subdivision of a _chapter_ or similar block that has a heading (but generally not a page break) and may itself be divided into sub-sections each level with a smaller heading.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254173/python-extract-ms-word-data-in-a-tree-structure/58254346#58254346","title":"Python: Extract MS Word data in a tree structure"}],"owner":{"reputation":490,"user_id":2600860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfuQl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ali Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2600860/ali-asad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58254346,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570337759,"creation_date":1570335532,"question_id":58254173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254173","body_markdown":"Is there any way I can extract MS Word file data in a tree structure.

Of course this is just a guess and I don&#39;t have your certificate to check this, but you can verify that by calling\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Sample for RSA, use DSA if required\r\nvar privateKeyParams = ((RSA)certificate.PrivateKey).ExportParameters(true);\r\n```\r\nwhich will cause a CryptographicException (&quot;Not supported&quot; or similar) if the key parameters cannot be accessed.\r\n\r\nPlease try the following instead for loading the certificate:\r\n```\r\nX509Certificate2 certificate = new X509Certificate2(\r\n  certificateFilePath, &quot;password&quot;,\r\n  X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable | X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet | X509KeyStorageFlags.UserKeySet);\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a further sidenote; If you use this in production code, be sure to extend your server certificate validation callback (your 4th line) to actually validate the server certificate. See [X509Chain.Build][1], which also allows you to modify the validation options to your needs (what the path validation actually does can be read in [RFC5280][2]).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

It is also relevant to ask where I should make calls to my new and improved print function...?\r\n\r\nThe following is my procedure for printing the merge sort vectors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n    Procedure: printMergeSort\r\n    Purpose:   prints merge sort steps to the console\r\n*/\r\n \r\nvoid printMergeSort(vector &lt;int&gt; left, vector &lt;int&gt; right)\r\n{\r\n \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; left.size(); ++i)\r\n    {\r\n \r\n        if (i == 0)\r\n            printf(&quot;[%d, &quot;, left[i]);\r\n        else if (i &lt; left.size() - 1)\r\n            printf(&quot;%d, &quot;, left[i]);\r\n        else\r\n            printf(&quot;%d], &quot;, left[i]);\r\n \r\n    }\r\n \r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; right.size(); ++i)\r\n    {\r\n \r\n        if (i == 0)\r\n            printf(&quot;[%d, &quot;, right[i]);\r\n        else if (i &lt; right.size() - 1)\r\n            printf(&quot;%d, &quot;, right[i]);\r\n        else\r\n            printf(&quot;%d] \\n&quot;, right[i]);\r\n \r\n    }\r\n \r\n}``\r\n```\r\n\r\nand my merge and mergesort code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n    Procedure: merge\r\n    Purpose:   Helper funcrion for mergeSort...\r\n               Sorts the subarrays and merges them\r\n*/\r\n \r\nvoid merge(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; leftVector, vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; rightVector, vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vectortoMerge)\r\n{\r\n \r\n    int lefttmostValue = leftVector.size();\r\n    int rightmostValue = rightVector.size();\r\n    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;\r\n \r\n    //printMergeSort(leftVector, rightVector);\r\n \r\n    while (j &lt; lefttmostValue and k &lt; rightmostValue)\r\n    {\r\n \r\n        if (leftVector[j] &lt; rightVector[k])\r\n        {\r\n \r\n            vectortoMerge[i] = leftVector[j];\r\n            //printf(&quot;%d &quot;, vectortoMerge[i]); \r\n            ++j;\r\n \r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n \r\n            vectortoMerge[i] = rightVector[k];\r\n \r\n            //printf(&quot;%d &quot;, vectortoMerge[i]);\r\n            ++k;\r\n \r\n        }\r\n \r\n        ++i;\r\n \r\n    }\r\n    while (j &lt; lefttmostValue)\r\n    {\r\n     \r\n        vectortoMerge[i] = leftVector[j];       \r\n        //printf(&quot;%d &quot;, vectortoMerge[i]);\r\n        ++j; ++i;\r\n \r\n    }\r\n \r\n    while (k &lt; rightmostValue) \r\n    {\r\n \r\n        vectortoMerge[i] = rightVector[k];\r\n        //printf(&quot;%d &quot;, vectortoMerge[i]);\r\n        ++k; ++i;\r\n \r\n    }\r\n \r\n}\r\n \r\n/*\r\n    procedure: mergeSort\r\n    Purpose:   Main function for the merge sort algorithm....\r\n               Splits the vector into 2 and makes a call the merge() function\r\n*/\r\n \r\nvoid mergeSort(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vectortoSort)\r\n{\r\n    if (vectortoSort.size() &lt;= 1) return;\r\n \r\n    int middleElement = vectortoSort.size() / 2;\r\n    vector&lt;int&gt; leftVector;\r\n    vector&lt;int&gt; rightVector;\r\n \r\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; middleElement; ++j)\r\n        leftVector.push_back(vectortoSort[j]);\r\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; (vectortoSort.size()) - middleElement; ++j)\r\n        rightVector.push_back(vectortoSort[middleElement + j]);\r\n \r\n    printMergeSort(leftVector, rightVector);\r\n    printf(&quot;, &quot;);\r\n    mergeSort(leftVector);\r\n    mergeSort(rightVector);\r\n    merge(leftVector, rightVector, vectortoSort);\r\n     \r\n \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected output is stated above but when inputting those values, I get the following:\r\n\r\n&gt; [14, 7, 3, 12], [9, 11, 6, 2][14, 7], [3, 12][14, [7, [3, [12, [9, 11], [6, 2][9, [11, [6, [2,\r\n\r\nIs there a better approach out there in order to solve this problem?

of all, you don&#39;t really need to do anything extra to set the request `Content-Type` as `application/json`. That&#39;s something that `HttpClient` does for you out of the box.\r\n\r\nNow as far as your error is concerned, that has something to do with CORS. Since this is an AJAX Request you&#39;re making for an API running on a separate PORT(8080) while your Frontend Application is running on a separate port(4200 most probably), the browser would block the request.\r\n\r\nTo allow, it would need `access-control-allow-origin: *` in the response headers. This is something that your browser would do by sending an `OPTIONS` call to the API first.\r\n\r\nSince the API doesn&#39;t really have `access-control-allow-origin: *` in the response header, it would be blocked. That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening here.\r\n\r\n## **FIX:**\r\n\r\nSince this is a POST API and you&#39;re running the server on the local, it&#39;s safe to assume that you can configure the REST API server to enable CORS.\r\n\r\nIf it were an express server you could enable CORS on it using the [**`cors`**][1] middleware.\r\n\r\n&gt; Here&#39;s a [**Frontend - Sample StackBlitz**][2] for your ref.\r\n\r\n&gt; Here&#39;s a [**Backend - CodeSandbox Sample**][3] for your ref.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html\r\n  [2]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/cors-post?file=src/app/app.component.ts\r\n  [3]: https://codesandbox.io/s/express-server-with-cors-ns5o2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254119/angular-8-httpclient-post-request-content-type-debacle/58254387#58254387","title":"Angular 8 HttpClient Post Request Content-Type debacle"}],"owner":{"reputation":334,"user_id":3862586,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7defd16eb87acb6e1e3f16f8c02d78fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NoobCoderChick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3862586/noobcoderchick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":334,"user_id":3862586,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7defd16eb87acb6e1e3f16f8c02d78fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NoobCoderChick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3862586/noobcoderchick"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58254387,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570419807,"creation_date":1570334826,"last_edit_date":1570419807,"question_id":58254119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58254119","body_markdown":"I&#39;m not sure what the deal is, hopefully someone can give me some help!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to make a POST to the backend API, but I get a 415 status code because the content-type is being sent as &quot;text/plain&quot; but this endpoint is expecting application/json.

have some code that is using the Java G Suite Admin API SDK.  It is driven by Adobe ColdFusion and has been working for 4-5 years now.  Suddenly, I am getting errors that don&#39;t make sense.  It seems like it is not connecting and creating the necessary objects or something has changed with the object requirements that I am not aware of.  I looked at the documentation online and nothing seems to have changed.\r\n\r\nUp until about a week ago, it has been working fine.  Then I started to get more errors, now I don&#39;t seem to be able to make any API updates.\r\n\r\nWhen password changes are attempted, the error that is returned from ColdFusion states that:\r\n\r\n&gt; The `setPassword` method was not found.::Either there are no methods\r\n&gt; with the specified method name and argument types or the `setPassword`\r\n&gt; method is overloaded with argument types that ColdFusion cannot\r\n&gt; decipher reliably. ColdFusion found `0 methods` that match the provided\r\n&gt; arguments. If this is a Java object and you verified that the method\r\n&gt; exists, use the javacast function to reduce ambiguity.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to create an email account I get : \r\n\r\n&gt; Not known\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not even certain where to start troubleshooting.  Is it possible that my admin account key expired?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254115/gsuite-admin-api-no-longer-working-for-user-updates","title":"GSuite Admin API no longer working for user updates"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8223}
